A Mountain Rise man is due back in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday after he was reminded in custody last week. Bhayla Mohamed (30) appeared last Thursday for dealing in ammunition, unlawful possession of ammunition and possession of drugs. According to the police, the 30-year-old was arrested on Wednesday last week in the Mountain Rise area. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Mohamed was arrested during an intelligence driven joint operation by the SAPS Team. Mbele said while the team was conducting the operation, they received information that a man was selling ammunition at Oaklands Drive and went to his home. She said a search revealed 23 boxes of 9mm luger rounds, each box containing 50 rounds. “A total of 1 150 rounds of ammunition, 200 cartridges, mandrax and two cellphones were recovered at the suspect’s residence. When he was questioned about the recovered items, he failed to provide adequate response and was arrested on the scene,” said Mbele. Mbele said Mohamed was remanded in custody for further investigation.
