MEC Sipho has urged residents and all sectors of society to partner with the provincial government in the fight against climate change. “All of us have to acknowledge that climate change is real, frequent and violent. We need to pay attention to all the severe weather warnings issued by the South African Weather Service to practice risk avoidance behaviour such as staying indoors, avoiding sporting and recreational activities during thunderstorms, and ensuring that we do not cross overflowing and running rivers either by car or on foot,” said Hlomuka.
