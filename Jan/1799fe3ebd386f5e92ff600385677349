The speaker of the Amajuba District Municipality in Newcastle, Reginald Ndima, was shot and killed outside his house on Saturday morning. It is alleged that he was gunned down in the early hours of the morning at his house in Newcastle. Details at this stage are still sketchy. A statement released by the district said the mayor and the entire leadership of the Amajuba District Municipality were in consultation with the family to gather all the necessary details. District mayor, Vuselwa Bam, said Ndima was one of the longest serving councillors and will be remembered for his endless efforts and selflessness in enhancing the lives of the people of Amajuba District. “My deepest sympathies go out to the family of the deceased, people of Amajuba District, the Amajuba District Municipality and all those who were close to councillor Ndima. May God give you the comfort and peace that you seek and may the soul of your loved one rest in peace,” said Bam. “He stunned us with his courage, persistence and perseverance. Despite his age he remained energetic and a source of knowledge especially to young and new councillors he served with.” Bam has called on law enforcement agencies to speedily bring the perpetrators to book. Ndima was recently elected as the Speaker of the council in the district's inaugural and first council meeting held on November 30.
