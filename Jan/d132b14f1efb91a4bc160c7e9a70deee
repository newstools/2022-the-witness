The ANC on Thursday suspended its Pietermaritzburg MP, Mervyn Dirks, following a fallout over his decision to lodge a complaint against President Cyril Ramaphosa. ANC Chief whip, Pemmy Majodina had instructed Dirks to withdraw a letter he had written to the National Assembly’s Select Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) requesting the committee to investigate Ramaphosa. However, when Dirks, who in his letter to Scopa claimed that Ramaphosa failed to inform the Zondo Commission about corruption within the ANC, did not withdrew his complaint. Majodina then sent the ANC MP a letter of suspension on Thursday morning The ANC also withdrew Dirks as the party’s member of Scopa. On Thursday, Dirks confirmed that he received the letter of suspension from Majodina. “However, I’m not at liberty to make any comment at this stage,” he said.
