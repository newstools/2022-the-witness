Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, has heaped praises on the matric class of 2021 for persevering throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. “The class of 2021 is literally and figuratively in a class of its own. “It is the only class so far that studied for two consecutive years under the state of disaster measures to mitigate against the spread of Covid-19,” she said on Thursday. Motshekga was speaking at a breakfast meeting in Auckland Park, Johannesburg where she hosted the country’s top 33 achieving matriculants from public schools. “You, the top learners of the class of 2021, are indeed the epitome that success comes at a price. You have shown through action, not an omission, that success is indeed a habit worth emulating,” she said. This is an annual event which precedes the official release of National Senior Certificate (NSC) result. Motshekga said the top achiever were great ambassadors of the country’s public schooling system which is “often under siege from free-market fundamentalists”. “These top learners’ awards provide us with a rare opportunity to shout over the rooftops about sustained excellence in our basic education system, focusing only on the crème de la crème of the system,” she said. The NSC results will be released on Friday morning with newspapers having been granted permission by courts to publish the examination numbers of the matriculants.
