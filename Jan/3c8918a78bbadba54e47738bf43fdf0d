Scattered showers and thundershowers are expected over KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday afternoon with some of the thunderstorms becoming severe over the midlands and north-eastern parts, warns the South African Weather Service (Saws). The weather office said these storms are expected to be accompanied by hail, heavy downpours, strong damaging winds and excessive lightning. The areas that will be affected include Abaqulusi, Big Five Hlabisa, Hluhluwe, Impendle, Ingwe, Jozini, KwaDukuza, Mandeni, Maphumulo, Mkhambathini, Msinga, Mthonjaneni, Mtubatuba, Ndwedwe, Nkandla, Nongoma, Nquthu, Richmond, Msunduzi, Ubuhlebezwe, Ulundi, Umhlabuyalingana, uMhlathuze, uMlalazi, uMngeni, uMshwathi, UMuziwabantu, Umvoti, Umzimkhulu and uPhongolo. The heavy downpours may lead to localised flooding of roads and low-lying bridges. The weather conditions could also cause damage to settlements and infrastructure over open areas due to strong winds and heavy downpours. Severe lightning can possibly result in localised fire incidents as well as injuries to humans and livestock. People are encouraged to stay indoors, if outdoors seek shelter immediately but not under trees, telephone and power lines.
