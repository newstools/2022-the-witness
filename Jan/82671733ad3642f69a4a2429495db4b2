Road M70 (Edendale Road) toward Gezubuzo area, Vulindlela, Pietermaritzburg has been closed after it started ‘sinking in’ on Monday morning. While it was still unclear what might be the cause for this, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport sent out a notice saying that the road would be closed until the portion was fixed. Motorists have been advised to use alternative roads. When The Witness visited the area, there were already construction workers working on the road. Community members had also gathered to see what was happened.
