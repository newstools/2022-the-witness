KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu on Monday went to assess some of the schools that were damaged in the recent storms that hit the province. He went Emzamweni High School, in Pietermaritzburg, which is among the schools that were severely affected. The storm damage left resource centre and some classrooms unusable. Mshengu also revealed that the number of schools affected by the storms and flooding had gone up from the initial 186 that he announced on Sunday but he did not have a concrete figure yet. At least 90 of the affected schools required mobile classrooms.
