Following persistent problems at uMngeni Municipality’s landfill site due to the lack of machinery and maintenance, it has hired machinery to clear the site. The municipality hired a TLB, tipper truck and a D7 dozer to clear the landfill site. uMngeni mayor, Chris Pappas, recently released a statement informing residents about the issues they were facing with the landfill site. Despite four weeks of heavy rains, lack of machinery and maintenance, the municipality also had issues with supervision and the management on site. Pappas said they will be hosting a meeting with waste pickers to educate them on the rules of the site and the role of the security on site. “This will be followed by a programme requiring them to register every morning to work on the site,” said Pappas. He added the municipality will also increase the number of security guards at the landfill site. “An investigation into the conduct of the site manager will commence. In the interim the head of community services will monitor the site by basing himself there next week,” said Pappas. uMngeni is also researching long term interventions looking at other municipalities in order to solve the problems they are facing at the landfill site.
