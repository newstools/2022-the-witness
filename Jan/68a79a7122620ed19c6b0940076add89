KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, on Sunday laid a wreath on the grave of ANC founding member and the party’s late president general, Josiah Gumede, at Pietermaritzburg’s Mountain Rise Cemetery. Zikalala, who was accompanied by Msunduzi Municipality mayor, Mzimkhulu Thebolla and ANC national executive committee (NEC) member, Dr Zweli Mkhize, described Gumede as one of the ruling party’s leaders who laid the foundation for a free South Africa. “He fought for the emancipation of the poor, women and the oppressed. “As the ANC we would have failed him if we were to allow poverty and the oppression of women to persist,” said Zikalala. Gumede was the ANC’s president general between 1927 and 1930. Zikalala’s visit to the grave of the late ANC president general was part of the build up to the party’s provincial 110th anniversary rally scheduled to be held in Mpopheni, in Howick on Sunday afternoon. The ANC, which lost Howick’s uMngeni Municipality to the DA in the November municipal elections, will use the Sunday rally to reflect its achievements and failures.
