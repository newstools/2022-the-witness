Uvongo Beach on the Durban South Coast will remain closed after the latest test results show high levels of E.coli in the water. The beach was closed on December 30 after the water was contaminated from a sewage leak. It was caused by damage to two sewage pump stations at the Masinenge low cost housing project. On Thursday night, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (Edtea) released a statement saying the beach was not safe to be re-opened yet. “(Uvongo Beach) will remain closed to the public use until water quality results reflected acceptable readings to allow for the reopening,” reads the statement. “The E.coli toxicity levels remain above the permissible threshold of 500. However, the latest results, especially for the sea and lagoon, are showing a substantial decrease in the water pollution.” E.coli is a bacteria usually found in water contaminated by human or animal faeces. It can cause diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pains and cramps. Edtea said the tests were conducted on January 5. The results show that the E.coli reading for Uvongo River, below the Masinenge impact point, was 5700. Uvongo lagoon was showing the reading of 2700 down from 8700 while the sea was at 1000, down from 5900. “A multi-departmental team that has been on the ground since the incident occurred has reported that there is no further spillage visible on site and repair work to the pumps is still underway but progressing satisfactorily,” reads the statement. More water results are expected in the next few days.
