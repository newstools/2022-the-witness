Durban North Beaches are now open and are safe for bathing and all sports activities. The beaches were closed with immediate effect on Wednesday after the Umngeni river discharged very abnormal murky waters to the beach. The municipality said following tests that were conducted, that they were reopening all beaches that were closed. “According to the results, water is free of any pollution that may pose a threat to life. “The water was murky because of hyacinths naturally found in the water. It usually increases during summer months.” The City went on to thank the public for always heeding its warnings.
