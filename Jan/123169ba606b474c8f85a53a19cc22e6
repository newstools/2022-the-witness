A man was shot dead on Thursday morning in Umhlanga, Durban, in what is believed to be a hit. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) and other emergency services were at around 10.30am standing off at the scene of the shooting. Rusa said its members were dispatched to the shooting on Meridian Drive in Umhlanga Ridge after residents reported rapid gunfire in the vicinity. On arrival, it was established that the driver of a white Toyota Corolla Cross had been shot while seated in his vehicle. Several rifle cartridges were recovered at the scene. Netcare 911’s spokesperson, Shawn Herbst, said photos from the scene show a white SUV with a shattered window, the door pockmarked with bullet holes. Reports indicate that a man, believed to be in his forties, had sustained multiple high calibre gunshot wounds throughout his body in what appears to be a hit, he said. The patient was assessed by a Netcare 911 paramedic, however he showed no signs of life and was declared dead at the scene. The circumstances leading up to the incident will be investigated by the relevant authorities who were on scene, added Herbst.
