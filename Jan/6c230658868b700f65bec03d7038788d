Former president Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, on Thursday endorsed a tweet labelling former public protector, Thuli Madonsoela, a hater of black people. This was after Madonsela suggested on her Twitter account that some powerful forces had hired a lawyer to represent Zandile Mafe – the homeless man accused of setting Parliament's building on fire. In her defence of Mafe, Zuma-Sambundla then retweeted a tweet lambasting Madonsela. Despite being homeless, Mafe is being represented by top lawyer, Luvuyo Godla. Zuma-Sambundla’s re-tweet was a continuation of her controversial comments on the Parliament fire saga. A week ago, shortly after the first fire in the National Assembly building broke out, the former president's daughter used her twitter account to thank those who started the fire. “Cape Town, we see you,” she said. The former president's daughter then followed with another tweet where she blamed the supporters of President Cyril Ramaphosa, whom she said was attempting to block an African Transformation Movement (ATM) motion of no confidence in the President. The ATM motion was due to be considered by the National Assembly in February. “There is no such thing as coincidence,” she wrote.
