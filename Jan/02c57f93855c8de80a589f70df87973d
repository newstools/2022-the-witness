 Msunduzi firefighters, who are accusing the municipality of dragging its feet over their back pay of about R24 million, marched to the Pietermaritzburg City Hall on Friday morning demanding answers from their employer.They said they were expecting to get their R24 million back pay in December 2021 but were told it was pushed to January. To their surprise, the firefighters said, they had been hearing from different sources that they would also not get their money this month.During Friday's protest, the firefighter forced their way into a municipal meeting demanding to be addressed by management.South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) uMgungundlovu regional secretary, Linda Gcabashe, this week told The Witness there had not been any direct communication between Msunduzi and the firefighters on the matter.In September The Witness reported that Msunduzi's executive committee had agreed to pay the firefighters a combined amount of R24 million in back pay as per the court ruling. This came after the firefighters threatened to take further legal action as the City was delaying paying them. At the time, their lawyers also threatened to interdict the municipality, saying they would institute legal action that would place municipal manager Madoda Khathide and administrator Scelo Duma in contempt of court.  *This is a developing story.
