All grades of fuel will see prices decrease this month, with petrol down between 68 cents and 71 cents per litre, and diesel decreasing by 67 and 69 cents per litre respectively. Here is the full list of changes: Petrol 95: decrease of 68 cents per litre Petrol 93: decrease of 71 cents per litre Diesel 0.05%: decrease of 67 cents per litre Diesel 0.005%: decrease of 69 cents per litre Illuminating Paraffin: decrease of 71 cents per litre The rand has regained some of its strength, improving the price of petrol back below R20 a litre. “The rand depreciated, on average, against the US dollar (from 15.40 to 15.92 rand per USD) during the period under review when compared to the previous one. This led to higher contributions to the basic fuel prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by about 29.00 cents per litre,” the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy said in a statement.
