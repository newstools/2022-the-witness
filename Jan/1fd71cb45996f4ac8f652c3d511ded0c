Three people, aged between 19 and 22 years old, were arrested by Pinetown detectives on Tuesday after they allegedly killed 22-year-old Sanele Kunene believing he had stolen speakers. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said it is alleged that on the December 30 at 5pm, five people went to Kunene’s home at Majuba lane in Wyebank and assaulted him. “He was accused of stealing speakers belonging to one of the suspects. Kunene sustained assault wounds to the body and head and was declared dead on the scene.” Mbele said a murder docket was opened at the Pinetown Police Station for further investigations. She said the investigation led to the arrest of the three people, while the remaining two are still at large but their arrest is imminent. Mbele said they are expected to appear at the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court soon. “The community is urged to refrain from taking the law into their own hands and they must let police continue doing their job by investigating and arresting the suspects involved in criminal activities,” said Mbele.
