Police arrested three truck drivers for working without proper permits during a compliance blitz near the Durban Harbour on Thursday morning. This comes after a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement agencies set up checkpoints on the entrance of Bayhead Port Terminal. Cargo trucks leaving the terminal had their goods inspected and the driver credentials were also scrutinised. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala, said the operation was aimed at ensuring compliance within the freight and logistics sector. “We are doing this because there have been complaints about the dominance of foreign nationals within the freight and logistics industry. These foreign nationals are supposed to be driving here on permits with all required documents,” said Zikalala. Zikalala added that the inspections would be carried out during the day, and more were planned in the near future. On Wednesday The Witness reported on the alleged attack of truck drivers from other countries during an unauthorised blockade on Old Airport Road, Durban. Foreign nationals were allegedly assaulted and their keys were taken away. Those who refused to stop had their trucks stoned.
