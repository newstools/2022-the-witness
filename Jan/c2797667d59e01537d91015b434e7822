Gunshots rang across the Gateway Mall, in Durban, during an armed robbery of a jewellery store on Sunday morning. Videos circulating on social media, showed shoppers scampering for cover inside the mall. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), it was the Montblanc Boutique that was robbed. The robbers made off with an undisclosed amount of items. “Shots were fired as they (the armed robbers) fled. No injuries were reported,” said Rusa. Rusa said the robbers fled south towards Galleria Mall in a silver Mercedes-Benz. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said five males armed with firearms entered the shop and used a hammer to break open glass cases and stole watches and expensive bags. "They escaped near Truworths entry and climbed into a silver Mercedes with registration NP." She said the value of the items taken was not known yet. In September, security officer Sihle Zulu was shot and later died during another armed robbery at jewellery store at the Gateway Mall.
