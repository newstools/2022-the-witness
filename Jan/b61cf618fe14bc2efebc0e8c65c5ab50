A herd of goats was reunited with its owner after being trapped at the base of a cliff at Stoffelton, Impendle, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, for four days. The community, who were worried about the safety of the nine goats since the water levels of Umkomazi River were rising, contacted the Howick SPCA. They then asked for assistance from Start Rescue. Spokesperson for Start rescue, Andreas Mathios, said volunteers used a rope and boat system set up to rescue the goats on Saturday. “All nine goats were finally brought to safety after a 3.5 hour operation. None of the animals were injured,” said Mathios. He added the rescue operation also involved SRU Ballito, Netcare911 Rescue as well as Netcare911 Advanced Life support paramedics who mobilised volunteers and resources to respond to the scene. Mathios said it was a happy ending. The goats were handed over to the owner.
