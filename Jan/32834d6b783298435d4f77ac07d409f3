The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has started evacuating residents in Ladysmith and Msinga who were affected by the recent floods. In a statement on Monday, the department said that 70 residents have been evacuated from the flooded areas in Ladysmith and moved to an indoor sports centre. The department added that disaster management teams are working together with various non-governmental organisations to provide immediate relief, such as blankets, sponges and hot meals to the affected residents. “The town of Ladysmith received significant rainfall over the weekend which led to the Kliprivier bursting its banks and flooding parts of the CBD. So far, there has been no reports of loss of life or injury as a result of this incident,” read the statement. Also, the department said in the town of Msinga, heavy rains caused the uThukela River to burst its banks and flood surrounding areas. It added that disaster management teams have also commenced with evacuating residents to safer places, such as community halls. KZN Cogta MEC, Sipho Hlomuka has since warned against building along river banks and crossing low-lying bridges. “We have recently experienced inclement weather conditions, which have left a trail of death and destruction in their wake. So far, 25 people have died with one person missing and R3.3 billion in damages has been incurred during the current summer season. We appeal to residents to be cautious,” said Hlomuka, adding that disaster management teams are continuing to monitor the situation across the province.
