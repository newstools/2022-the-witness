A man was electrocuted on Tuesday morning while trying to steal electric cables at Shiyabazi informal settlement in Howick. Ward councillor Siyabonga Lamula said he is concerned about the dangers cable theft pose to residents. Lamula said the man, believed to be in his 20s, has not yet been identified by any of the community members. He was accompanied by other people, but they ran away when he was electrocuted. “The residents close to the pole said they heard noises early in the morning and when they looked outside they saw sparks and men cutting the cable from the pole and digging it out of the ground,” said Lamula. Residents told him they ask the men to stop because they were worried the sparks would cause a fire and damage their homes. Their pleas were ignored. He said the fact that the community did not know the man who was electrocuted “means people outside the settlement are coming in to steal these cables, endangering the lives of many”. The informal settlement does not currently have electricity. Lamula said a few residents who can afford to, have bought solar panels to light their homes. Due to the high rate of crime in the area, uMngeni municipality has installed solar street lights for residents. Lamula said even though this had helped, there were still cases of murder and cable theft in the settlement. He added as a new councillor in the area, he was looking into reforming current structures, including the community policing forum, to keep the area safe. “Although a lot happens in the settlement, including murder cases that emanate from fights, they still need to feel safe,” said Lamula. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, Captain Kholeka Mhlongo said the electrocuted man has not been identified. “Howick police are investigating an inquest docket,” said Mhlongo.
