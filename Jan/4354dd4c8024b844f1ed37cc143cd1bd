Truck drivers have been assaulted and had their trucks stoned during a truck blockade on Old Airport Road in Durban on Wednesday morning. It is alleged that local drivers who had embarked on a blockade were stopping trucks and requesting drivers to provide their identification documents. Foreign nationals were assaulted and their keys were taken away. Those who refused to stop had their trucks stoned. Durban’s Metro police spokesperson senior superintendent Parboo Sewpersad confirmed the incident and said it took place just after 10am this morning. He said a team of officers had been dispatched to the area following a number of complaints from residents and motorists. “Our officers managed to clear the whole area and metro police officers are still in the area to ensure stability,” said Sewpersad. This is a developing story.
