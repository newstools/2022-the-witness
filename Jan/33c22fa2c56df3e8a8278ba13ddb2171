There was a bit of excitement on community chat groups around Pietermaritzburg after a huge dark cloud was seen hovering over KZN’s capital on Friday afternoon. While some joked that it was a tornado “to finish us off” others rushed to close their doors and windows fearing another storm was approaching. “All bad things happen here so why not just hit us with a tornado while you’re at it,” joked a Mountain Rise resident. A motorist also shared a cellphone video of the said cloud taken from the N3. “I don’t know what’s going on but I want to go home,” she is heard saying. Another person in the car who also sounds worried says the cloud is also “turning”.
