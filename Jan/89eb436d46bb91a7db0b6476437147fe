Twitter has been abuzz after Showmax released a picture of the season two cast members of the Real Housewives of Durban on Monday. The second installment of the local adaption of the popular US Real Housewives will not be without changes. Things have been shaken up this coming season, with three new housewives added to the cast. News of the new housewives was first teased on streaming platform Showmax's Twitter account when they shared a picture of the cast. The cast image cleverly showcases new cast members among a few remaining cast members to create hype for season two. The three newbies are covering their lower faces with opulent fans in the picture, but many recognised one of Musa Mseleku’s four wives, Thobile MaKhumalo Mseleku, who features in the Uthando Nesithembu reality show, right away and wasted no time in sharing how excited they were for the new season.  The two other new personalities joining MaKhumalo are Londie London and Jojo Robinson after Ayanda Ncwane’s exit. Old housewives that are returning to season two of the hit reality show include Sorisha Naidoo, Nonkanyiso Conco, Anne-Tonni Lodick Mthembu, and Nonku Williams. Showmax announced the return of the franchise in September 2021 but hasn’t confirmed when the reality show will air on the channel.
