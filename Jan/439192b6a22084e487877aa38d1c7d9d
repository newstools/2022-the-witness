A group of 50 traditional healers, musicians and members of the public are set to embark on a 100 km walk to commemorate the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana on Friday. The three-day Isandlwana Walk from Ulundi to Isandlwana will be led by internationally acclaimed artist and historian, Mbuso Khoza. Khoza’s Mbuso Khoza Institute for Culture and Heritage has organised the walk in honour of the Zulu warriors who fought against British forces in January 1879. Khoza told The Witness that the aim of the initiative is to rekindle the spirit of ubuntu and moral regeneration in South Africa. He said the walk will also connect the participants to the spirits of their forefathers who fought in the Battle of Isandlwana. Khoza said his inspiration for the three-day journey comes from a significant role played by his great-grandfather Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza — who was in charge at the battle. Ntshingwayo was the commanding general of King Cetshwayo kaMpande’s regiments. “We are living in a society that is faced with many societal problems. “During our journey to Isandlwana, we will also be raising awareness on issues of gender-based violence. “We will educate the people about the importance of connecting with their cultural roots. We want to figure out what is it that our nation has lost over the years. We will be praying to our ancestors to assist the nation and bring solutions on the societal problems that our country is facing,” Khoza said. The Zululand District Municipality has partnered with Khoza in hosting the Isandlwana Walk, which will also see historian Professor Otty Nxumalo presenting a lecturer to the participants.
