Police have confirmed that a complaint of a KZN Midland’s school was reported to the Pietermaritzburg Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FVCPSO) unit this week. This comes after the prestigious school’s governing body (SGB) received allegations of a former staffer that was accused engaging in “unacceptable behaviour” with pupils. They reported the matter at Alexander police station on Monday morning.The SGB said this was also officially reported to the KZN Education Department on January 14 and again further correspondence was sent on Tuesday.“Colonel Bezuidenhout of the SAPS is dealing with this matter. It was reported to her yesterday (Monday) morning. The school and governing body will continue to work with the Education Department and the police,” said the SGB.On Tuesday, The Witness reported that school had also engaged a professional, independent and objective investigation team to look into the matter. "We adopt a zero tolerance approach when it comes to issues such as this," the SGB said. While the school would not divulge the details of the complaint to the police and the education department, it confirmed that the staffer involved had resigned.“These transgressions came to our attention in January and the time frames will be the subject of the investigation.“The person is not in the employment of the school after resigning of their own volition. We believe that the reasons given for leaving the school’s employ were both professional and personal.”* In an earlier version of this story, The Witness incorrectly reported that the SGB had confirmed that the allegations against the former staffer were of a sexual nature. The SGB has not confirmed this. Witness apologises for this error.
