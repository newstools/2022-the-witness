A man, Douglas Motaula (35), who is accused of murdering Prestbury woman, Sharon Deetlefs, was remanded in custody on Wednesday. The man made his first appearance in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning. He was tracked down and arrested by a team from the Prestbury Police Station on Monday. Deetlefs (62) was allegedly strangled to death in her home in Bellevue Road on Thursday evening. She lived alone in the house. Deetlefs was retired and had previously worked as a broker’s assistant in the City. Motaula is charged on three counts; murder, housebreaking with intent to steal and theft, and illegal immigration. His matter was adjourned to next week Wednesday, January 12, for a possible bail application. Arrangements will also be made for a special interpreter to be present in court as Motaula does not speak a South African language. KwaZulu-Natal provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele told The Witness on Sunday that Deetlefs reported previous housebreakings to police. She said a postmortem report is being awaited on the cause of death. Deetlefs’ murder left the Prestbury community in shock, as many called for an increase in police visibility in the area. According to the local ward councillor, Ross Strachan, this was not the first time that Deetlefs had criminals break into her home. He said it is believed that she might have been targeted. The community had also urged the private security companies together with the Community Police Forum (CPF) to constantly monitor the area as there was a growing trend of crimes such as burglary, housebreak-ins and theft.
