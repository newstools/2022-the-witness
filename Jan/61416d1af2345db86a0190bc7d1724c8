Security guards at Umbumbulu Coastal Tvet College in Durban have downed tools over not receiving their December salaries. The guards placed burning tyres and trees at the entrance of the school on Tuesday morning. One guard, who asked not to be named, told The Witness that this was not the first time their salaries were delayed. “There are a lot of issues we are dealing with. Sometimes our salaries don’t come in full and sometimes they are delayed, we are not being paid for overtime or the wrong salary rate, it’s actually frustrating,” they said. The guards at the institution are outsourced from a private security company called Calvin and Family Security. “The company is telling us one thing and the college is telling us another, so we are not sure who has not paid who,” said one guard. The guards said they will intensify their protests throughout the day until someone addresses their concerns. *This is a developing story.
