Newly-crowned SA Player of the Year Siya Kolisi and fellow Springbok Bongi Mbonambi are back in the Sharks team that will face the Stormers in the United Rugby Championship (URC) in Durban on Saturday. Sharks coach Sean Everitt announced his matchday 23 on Thursday with only two changes, as James Venter and Kerron van Vuuren make way for Kolisi and Mbonambi, respectively. Kolisi, who was announced as the winner of the SA Player of the Year accolade earlier on Thursday, and Mbonambi missed the Sharks’ thrilling victory over the Lions in Egoli last weekend. The former Stormers duo weren’t considered for selection for the Joburg trip as they had an extended break in December compared to other players. It came as no big surprise that Kolisi walked away with the big prize on Thursday as he has been in fine form, especially for the Springboks last year. The Bok skipper took the award ahead of his captain at the Sharks, Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Eben Etzebeth and try wizard Makazole Mapimpi. Aphelele Fassi, who will start at fullback for the Sharks on Saturday, was named SA Rugby Young Player of the Year ahead of Sharks teammate Jaden Hendrikse, Jordan Hendrikse, Elrigh Louw and Evan Roos. Fassi made his Springbok debut last year and featured in two Tests, scored tries on both occasions. Against the Stormers, the Sharks will be looking to extend their winning run to three matches while the Capetonians are coming off a great victory against the Bulls last weekend. The match at Durban’s Kings Park will kick-off at 5.05 pm on Saturday.
