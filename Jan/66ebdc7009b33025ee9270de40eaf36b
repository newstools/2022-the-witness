At 101 years old, a Mtubatuba granny, Thembekile Gumede, is a the first-time homeowner. This comes after KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala visited the Gumede household at Mpukunyoni under Mtubatuba Local Municipality, in northern KZN to celebrate the life of Gogo Gumede. He also honoured her with a brand-new home. The home has been specifically designed to accommodate Gumede who is wheelchair bound. “With ailments of different kinds associated with old age creeping in along the way, the new home which has been specifically designed to cater to gogo Gumede’s needs, will bring much needed relief to the centenarian,” he said at the visit. Zikalala highlighted the importance of honouring and caring for the elderly. He said those who have been blessed to live beyond 100-years-old are reservoirs of indigenous knowledge that everyone can all learn from. An overjoyed gogo Gumede, thanked Zikalala for the new home. She said she was grateful to be recognised in her old age and offered blessings to her visitors. Through the MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation Hlengiwe Mavimbela, who was moved by the family’s plight, the provincial government intervened to improve Gogo Gumede’s living conditions as well as her overall health and well-being.
