Well-known South Coast snake catcher, Sarel van der Merwe, removed two green mambas in one bird cage in Uvongo on Sunday. The snake catcher said the two green mambas that he removed in Uvongo had already eaten three finches that were in the cage. Van der Merwe started the new year by removing the two green mambas and a black mamba in Mvutshini, outside of Margate, all in the same day. “I had a call from Kevin Ryan from Uvongo at 9am on Sunday morning for a green mamba in his bird cage that had eaten one finch,” said van der Merwe. He added that at 4pm on the same day, Ryan called him again requesting assistance with another green mamba that had ate two other finches in the same bird cage. Van der Merwe said the second green mamba was slightly bigger than the first one. “I had to catch it quickly because I had a call for a black mamba in Mvutshini, inland from Margate. The black mamba was first on the house stoep before it went into a sealed drain,” said van der Merwe, adding that the owner of the house was brave enough to close the drain with a block.
