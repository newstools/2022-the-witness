The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has clarified that no ‘matric upgrade centre’ or ‘UKZN foundation programme’ opportunity has been approved, sanctioned or authorised by the university. Grade 12 pupils, their parents and guardians are warned against applying to or registering at any matric upgrade centre claiming to be associated with UKZN. The university said it has not approved or sanctioned the use – which is illegal – of its name, logo, branding, campuses, lecture venues and or residences by these businesses. “There is no relationship between these centres and the university. Their operation on UKZN campuses is illegal and not permitted. They are falsely creating the impression that they are in a partnership with the university. “The university is aware that many previous applicants to illegal ‘matric upgrade centres’ were left in an unfavourable position after losing their money to these businesses. “The university will institute legal action against any matric upgrade centre found to be unlawfully representing itself as being associated with the university, and where such centre conducts business on and/or uses any of the UKZN facilities for such purposes.” If you are uncertain about ‘upgrading your matric’ and require further information and guidance, please contact the Department of Basic Education at www.education.gov.za, the KZN Department of Education at www.kzneducation.gov.za, or the high school where you were registered for and wrote your 2021 NSC examinations for help.
