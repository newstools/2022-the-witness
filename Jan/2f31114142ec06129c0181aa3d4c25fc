The matric results will not be published in the media this year to protect the identity of pupils. This is because of the Protection of Personal Information Act, which came into effect in July. Elijah Mhlanga, spokesperson of the national and provincial Department of Basic Education, said in a statement to all media, that in order to comply with the provisions of the Act, the usual practice of publishing the national senior certificate (NSC) results on public platforms (media platforms) will not occur for the 2021 results. He said the department recognises the section in the Constitution that provides that everyone has the right to privacy. “This right to privacy includes a right to protection against the unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information,” he said. Mhlanga added that all pupils will be required to obtain their statement of results from the schools they attended. “In this way their personal information with regards to the outcome of their national senior certificate exam will be protected,” he added.
