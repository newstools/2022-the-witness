KwaZulu-Natal police are looking for relatives of a man whose skeletal remains were recently found in a farm in Port Edward, on the KZN South Coast. According to KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, Port Edward police found the remains last week when they were called to the farm. Mbele said it was suspected that the deceased was a man because of the clothing that was found on the scene. The man was wearing black tracksuit pants, a bottle green cap, checked boxer shorts and a t-shirt, said Mbele. “We are appealing to members of the public to assist police in finding the relatives of the deceased,” she said, adding that anyone with information is requested to contact Detective Sergeant Mzizi on 039 311 5430, 073 1397 646 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
