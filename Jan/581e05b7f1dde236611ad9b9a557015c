Another armed robbery has hit one of the businesses on the corner of Church and Retief streets in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday morning. It is alleged that six armed men entered a clothing store that specialises in schoolwear, and took some items from the shop and fled the scene. According to Shaheen Suleiman, the owner of Magma Security & Investigations, the incident took place just after 9 am. Suleiman said at this stage, they do not have details of what the men might have taken and also security teams are on the ground. The business robbery incident came after the city has been experiencing ongoing armed robberies. Many people believe it is the same gang targeting the local businesses. During the month of December and in early January, a number of robberies were reported, with many of the suspects involved still at large.
