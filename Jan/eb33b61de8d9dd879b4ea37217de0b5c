Rushing rivers which have burst their banks in the Winterton area, near the Drakensberg, have left the community there concerned about the threats of flood damage. They've also damaged bridges. The rivers swelled after heavy rains on Thursday afternoon. Many parts of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands have experienced heavy rains in recent weeks which have left the ground saturated. According to the residents in the Winterton area, motorists and ambulances could not cross a number of bridges as they were overflowing. “The situation was bad and as a result ambulances with patients were stuck.  A bridge on the Cathedral Peak Road, Winterton, was under water  and ambulances going to Emmaus Hospital and other motorists were unable  to cross,” said a resident. There were also reports that the Glen Grey dam near the Cathedral Peak Wine Estate could possibly burst its banks. However, when The Witness arrived at Glen Grey Dam, farmers in the area said fortunately, the dam wall's banks had not burst and there was no damage to their crops. It is alleged that one person nearly drowned after attempting to cross a raging river but was pulled out of the water by community members. Okhahlamba Municipality said their disaster management teams are still on the ground to establish the extent of the damage caused by the heavy rains. The department of transport's teams are also repairing the damaged roads and bridges.
