The stage is set as the long-awaited Zulu royal family court case is expected to get underway at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday morning. The court case between members of the Zulu royal family was scheduled to take place in December, but was postponed. Izintombi, led by Dr Nomagugu Ngobese, have also gathered outside court singing and holding cards in support of Prince Misuzulu. Ngobese, who is a respected cultural activist and founder of the Nomkhubulwane Culture and Youth Development Organisation, said no matter what happens, Prince Misuzulu is the only king they will recognise. She said regardless of the outcomes of the court proceedings, they can never be told by "papers" who their king is because according to their norms, the king is chosen by the people. Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu wants to inherit 50 percent of the estate of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini saying they were married in civil rites and she is the first wife. There is also another matter in court which is part of the royal house court battle. In this matter Prince Mbonisi filed urgent court papers to stop the alleged coronation of King Misuzulu. The third matter is between the queen’s daughters, Princess Ntandoyenkosi and Ntombizosuthu Zulu, who wants the king’s will to be declared invalid, claiming that the signature on the will was forged. The matter is due to he heard in court on Tuesday.
