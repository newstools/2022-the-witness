Another person died on Monday after being ejected from a taxi on the R617 on Kingscote towards Kokstad in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. According to the Underberg Emergency Medical Services, three taxis were involved in the crash. A woman in her 30s was ejected from the taxi and died at the scene. Three other people had minor injuries. The emergency services base manager, Kate Bodmann, said on Sunday a man in his 30s was ejected from his rolling car on the same road, close to the bend. He was hit by another car and died at the scene. “This area is a high accident zone. Since December, three people have died on this same road,” said Bodmann. She added in December a driver lost control and went over the barrier down to the mountains. “We’ve tried numerous times to get the barrier fixed because cars seem to go down the barrier since then. We also asked for the road to have speed humps but nothing has been done,” said Bodmann. She said the road was steep with a sharp bend and there’s always high volume of cars travelling on it either going to the Eastern Cape or Johannesburg during the festive season. Bodmann said between December 2020 and January 2021 at least five people died on the R617 on Kingscote towards Kokstad.
