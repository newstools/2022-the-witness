A 15-year-old boy drowned at Pipeline Beach near Amanzimtoti on Thursday. According to Robert McKenzie, spokesperson for KZN Emergency Medical Services, lifeguards had attempted to revive the boy. “Lifeguards attempted to perform CPR, however this was sadly not successful,” he said. In another incident on Thursday, two men in their 30s were swept out to sea at Brighton Beach, Durban. “Members of the public called emergency services and when emergency services arrived on the scene they found that one man had been rescued by members of the public,” McKenzie said. He said paramedics assessed the man and found that he was in a serious condition. “He was stabilised at the scene before being transported to hospital for continued medical care.” The second man is still missing at sea and the search is ongoing, McKenzie said.
