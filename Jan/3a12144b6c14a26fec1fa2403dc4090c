The KZN Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison has issued a stern warning to protesting residents of Ngome outside Greytown to stop blocking the road. The department’s spokesperson, Thuba Vilane, said acts of violent protests hampers service delivery. “We are very much aware that residents have a right to protest, however the acts of violent protests will not be tolerated as this inconveniences other people who are using the same road that is blocked. “Such violent protests inconvenience thousands of road users who use the same road daily. “We urge the members of the public to visit the relevant departments to raise their concerns without blocking off the road,” Vilane said. The protesting residents are demanding that electricity be restored in the area. Last week, they told the The Witness that more than 10 households had been without electricity since November after a local transformer caught fire last year. In a video circulating on social media, motorists can be seen swerving to avoid the debris and huge stones left by protesters on the road on Wednesday. Motorists are urged to use alternative routes.
