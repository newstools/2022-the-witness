Thompson’s Bay beach in Ballito will remain closed for the rest of the week. This comes after the beach was closed on Monday when a sewage spill contaminated the water. It was believed the spill was caused by an electricity outage on Sunday that affected large parts of the North Coast. However, investigations by independent water services provider Siza Water and the KwaDukuza Municipality revealed that a blockage created by excessive sand entering the municipal showers sewer connection caused the overflow. Siza Water will remove the sand from the sewer pump situated on Simbithi Drive during the night this week. They are not able to undertake this during the day as the sewage inflow is too high. According to KwaDukuza Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize the reason the diesel pumps at the pump station gave up was because the showers take in sand. He said there is no flow where the water goes in and sand is left behind resulting in it all going into the sewer. He said they would need to do improvements at Thompson’s beach. He said they were conducting water tests on a 24 hour basis and hoped to have the beach open again by Friday at the latest.
