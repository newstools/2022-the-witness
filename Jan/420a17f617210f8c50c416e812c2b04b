A correctional services official and a private citizen were arrested in the early hours on Saturday morning after attempting to smuggle contraband into the Westville Prison, in Durban. The pair were attempting to smuggle in three parcels of dagga, 924 white and blue capsules of whoonga, 50 white round tablets, one cellphone and a charger. The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) said in a statement a car with two occupants was stopped by patrolling officers within the premises on Saturday around 1 am. “One person opted to flee, evading the officials who were closing in. The driver of the vehicle (a private citizen) was eventually apprehended, he disclosed the identity of his associate as a DCS official,” the statement reads. The DCS official was found several hours later trapped and screaming for help inside a storm water drain at the prison. The official was arrested and taken into custody along with the contraband found in his “hideout spots”. “DCS is leaving nothing to chance as its commitment towards contraband free centres is in full swing. It is a 360-degree focused intervention as attention is given to every inmate, official, service provider, visitor and residence within our premises,” the department warned.
