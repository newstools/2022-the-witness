Two women aged 81 and 82 years old were murdered at their home in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. They were allegedly hacked to death by a 37-year-old man believed to be one of the women’s son. The incident took place in the KwaNdaba area, Umhlabuyalingana. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said the alleged killed was assaulted by community members and is under police guard in hospital. It is alleged that he accosted his family then brutally hacked his mother with a bush knife. He later killed his aunt who had tried to intervene after hearing cries and pleas for help. In a statement, KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza, said she was extremely disturbed and disheartened by the murder. She said she was shocked by the extent of violence directed at vulnerable people. “Young people are supposed to be the ones who protect the elderly. However, it is disgusting that pain is inflicted by the same young people who are supposed to protect our senior citizens,” said Khoza. She added these incidents called for vigorous action between the community, government and different sectors. “We want to see all vicious men serving years in prison. These killers do not deserve bail. Although we subscribe to the principle of innocence until proven otherwise, the justice system must be seen to be doing its level best to deal with injustices directed at women and children,” she said. Khoza commended the arrest.
