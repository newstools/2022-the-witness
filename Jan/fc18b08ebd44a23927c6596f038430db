Businesses near the recently burnt down Xinhua Distribution Centre have been evacuated as the City of Durban prepares to demolish what is left. “The building has been condemned following assessments by structural engineers appointed by the building owners at the request of eThekwini Municipality,” reads a statement from the City on Friday. “Businesses in the precinct have been evacuated while some road lanes remain closed as the structural integrity of the building is believed to be compromised.” The centre was gutted by a fire that broke out from its ground floor pump room on January 21. Employees had to exit the burning building top floor windows and were later rescued by fire fighters. One person was seriously injured after landing badly from jumping out of the window. The Witness recently reported that eThekwini found that the building was not compliant with fire safety measures during its last inspection in October 2021. Fire fighters have been fighting the fire in the building from outside as it was deemed unsafe to enter. The City said fire fighters will maintain a presence near the building as a safety precaution.
