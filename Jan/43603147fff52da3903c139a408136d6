Four people were killed and a further six critically injured during a fatal mass shooting near a hostel in KwaMakhutha, in Durban. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said a group of men were sitting under a tree on Sunday afternoon when unknown vehicle pulled up next to them. “The occupants of the vehicle opened fire at the group, killing three and injuring seven others. The seven men were rushed to hospital for medical attention,” said Mbele. The Witness has reliably learned that one person has since died, taking the death toll to four. Mbele said when police arrived at the scene they found the bodies of three men with multiple gunshot wounds. “The motive for the attack is yet to be established as investigations are ongoing. Charges of murder and attempted murder was opened at KwaMakhutha SAPS for further investigation,” said Mbele.
