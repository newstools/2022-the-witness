The MK Veteran part of the Liberation Struggle War Veterans (LSWV) group is marching to the KwaZulu-Natal premier’s office to hand over their memorandum of demand to premier Sihle Zikalala on Tuesday morning. They said they had been having meetings with Zikalala’s office since last year but later stopped as they had no fruitful results. Thamisanqa Mngadi, a member of the LSWV, said the military veterans association has not done anything for military veterans for the past 27 years. “We are still poor, homeless unemployed and living below poverty line while the military veterans association executives are enriching themselves and those who are close to them at the expense of the military veterans,” said Mngadi. He added they were handing the memorandum to Zikalala as he is part of the Presidential and National Task Team. “We want to find out what he has planned for us as our premier," he said. *This is a developing story.
