It took 83 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) before an Umzimkulu Covid-19 sufferer was allowed to go home. Jubilation accompanied Mzwandile Dlamini being discharged from ICU on December 20. Dlamini was happy to be going home, just in time to celebrate Christmas with his family. Dlamini’s road to recovery was not easy, however, Eden Gardens Private Hospital (EGPH) ICU nurses and treating doctor Chuma Jozi believed that the 58-year-old would regain his health day by day. Dlamini said he had lost hope because he was in ICU for such a long time. He said as the days went by, he noticed he began to lose weight and was slowly losing his energy. His recovery has been a rollercoaster ride, as he lost and gained his appetite, he said. Due to Covid-19, Dlamini experienced breathing issues and said at times, he felt his chest “closing up”. Dlamini praised his doctor and the nurses at Eden Gardens for nursing him back to health and renewing his faith that he could recover. Dlamini, who had been away from home for close to three months, said his grandchildren had been asking where he was. Eden Gardens ICU manager, sister Jane Kone and nursing manager sister Precious Shelembe said they were extremely proud of the hospital’s nursing staff and ICU team. “Our ICU team is proud to have nursed Mr. Dlamini back to health; it hasn’t been easy, but teamwork ensured we all played our part in Mr. Dlamini’s healing process”, said Kone. Dlamini encouraged anyone with Covid-19 to not lose hope as he is living proof that full recovery is possible.
