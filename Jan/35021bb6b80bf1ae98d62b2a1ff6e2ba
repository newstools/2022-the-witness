Everything has been brought to a standstill in ward 9, under Msunduzi Municipality in Pietermaritzburg due to a community protest. Residents have closed the main road, the R617, and other small roads entering and exiting the area with burning tyres, stones and wood. They are protesting over the electricity load reduction that takes place from 5pm to 9pm everyday. Ward councillor Mduduzi Mshengu said he was aware of the protest. He said he has had a meeting with Eskom regarding the issue and it was explained to them that the majority of the people in the area are not paying for electricity that is why Eskom has implemented the load reduction. The affected areas include Phenduka, Ngcedomhlophe, Khobongwaneni, Esilaheni and Khethi which falls under ward 8. “The community is aware of this because we explained it to them after our meeting with Eskom. We don’t know why they decided to protest now. “We are currently waiting for the police so that we can take the leaders of the protest to the Eskom office in Mkondeni so they will hear from the horse’s mouth why they are having load reduction,” he said. *This is a developing story.
