A man was shot in the back of the head through the passenger seat of a car during a high-speed chase in Newlands East, Durban. According to KZN VIP Response, on Monday night, two men were driving their Silver VW Polo along Yellowfin and Hippo Road when they were followed by a white VW Polo. The occupants of the white Polo fired two shots at the two men. “The driver of the silver Polo couldn’t evade the vehicle that was gunning them down, so his acquaintant, sitting in the passenger seat, was a victim to a gunshot wound to his head,” said KZN VIP in a statement. “The male that was driving the silver Polo pulled off in the middle of the road, exited the vehicle and ran into the bushes as his wounded acquaintant remained in the car due to injury and the white Polo drove off in an unknown direction.” When police arrived the man emerged from the bushes to give his statement. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, KwaZulu-Natal provincial police spokesperson, said charges of attempted murder are being investigated by Newlands East SAPS. The injured man was taken to a nearby hospital for medical attention, she said.
