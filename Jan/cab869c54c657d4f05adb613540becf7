Thompson’s Bay Beach in Ballito, on the KZN North Coast, is now open to the public. The beach has been closed since Monday after a sewage spill contaminated the water. It was initially believed the spill was caused by an electricity outage that affected large parts of the North Coast on Sunday. However, investigations by independent water services provider Siza Water and the KwaDukuza Municipality later revealed that a blockage created by excessive sand entering the municipal showers sewer connection caused the overflow. The municipality has since undertaken to install a sand trap at the showers to prevent sand getting into the sewer system again. KwaDukuza Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize on Friday said the Thompson’s Bay Beach is safe for public use and bathing following the precautionary closure on Monday. “Water test results received by the municipality confirm the quality to be good, hence the local authority’s decision to reopen the facility. “The municipality appreciates the high levels of corporation shown during the past few days,” he said.
