The pet anaconda that escaped a temporary enclosure in Starwood, Phoenix, last week has been found. Speaking to The Witness on Monday morning, owner of the almost two-metre long female yellow anaconda, Preesen Nair, confirmed that the snake was found. However, he said he would not be speaking any further about the snake. He did not provide details on how, when, where or in what condition the snake was found. The black and yellow female snake named Medusa, a non-venomous constrictor, escaped from Troy Street, where Nair lives, while being housed in a temporary enclosure while her cage was being maintained on Thursday. Despite Nair saying Medusa was harmless and docile, people on social media are still expressing relief that she has been found. Urissa Munsamy commented, “As long as it has been found. Can put this story to rest now!”
