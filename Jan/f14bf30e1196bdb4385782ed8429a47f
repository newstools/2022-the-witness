A two metre long yellow anaconda escaped from its enclosure and is on the loose in Starwood, Phoenix in KZN. The non-venomous constrictor apparently escaped from Troy Street, where the owner, Preesen Nair lives, while being housed in a temporary enclosure while her cage was being maintained. The black and yellow female snake named Medusa could easily constrict small cats and dogs, according to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) who are helping to search for the anaconda. While the snake will grow more over time, she is relatively smaller than the green anaconda popularly seen in the movie of the same name. According to her owner she is harmless and relatively docile. However, Nair said people who do not have experience with snakes should not try to capture her and rather call for assistance. He said she is a family pet and appealed to anyone who may find her to return her unharmed. If anyone spots the anaconda, contact Nair on 082 605 9530, snake catcher Jason Arnold on 082 745 6375 or Rusa at 086 1234 333.
