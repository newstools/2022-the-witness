A five-year-old girl drowned in a swimming pool in Camperdown, in the KwaZulu-Natal, on Sunday afternoon. According to the Mi7 National Group’s Emergency Medical Services, the incident happened just after 2 pm. Mi7’s Colin David said their medical team was dispatched to the Camperdown area after receiving reports of a child who was unresponsive. David said on arrival, paramedics found an off-duty paramedic attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the five-year-old girl. “Mi7 medics urgently administered advanced life support interventions and packaged the patient for transport to hospital where further resuscitation attempts could be made. “The patient was handed over to waiting specialist doctors who then continued the resuscitation,” he said. Unfortunately, said David, after a full resuscitation attempt, there was nothing further that could be done for the child and she was declared deceased at the hospital. David added that the police are investigating the incident.
