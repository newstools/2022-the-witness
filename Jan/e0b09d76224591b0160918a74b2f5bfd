The KwaZulu-Natal Education is on the right course and the system is responding positively to the ideals of quality and relevant education for all pupils. This was proven by the improvement of matric results in 2021. Department MEC Kwazi Mshengu said the class of 2021 has proven to be the most resilient class in recent history given that it had to contend with two years of Covid19 disruption. “Unlike the 2020 Grade 12 learners, this cohort is the one that lost a lot of time for several months in Grade 11 and missed out on an opportunity to cover certain learning areas that would have better prepared them for Grade 12. “It had to contend with July unrest which forced us to cancel our annual winter classes. Today we stand proud that notwithstanding all these and related difficulties, the performance of the class of 2021 is an outstanding 76.8%, which is a marginal 0.8% decrease from the performance of the class of 2020,” said Mshengu. He was addressing dignitaries at a virtual ceremony to release the 2021 matric results in Estcourt High school under uThukela District municipality. Mshengu said his department had last year set out 10 areas which needed to be improved, and eight of those were achieved. “We wanted to increase the number of learners passing matric in 2021.  Indeed, we increased from 104 938 in 2020 to 127 990 in 2021.We wanted to increase the number of schools passing at 100%.  Indeed, we increased from 140 in 2020 to 145 in 2021.  We have also seen an increase in the schools from quintile 1-3 that performs between 91% - 100%. We wanted to increase the number of bachelor passes and we increased the number from 51 074 in 2020 to 61 856 in 2021. We are number 1 in the country,” he said. The number of diploma passes has increased from 35 214 in 2020 to 42 128 in 2021, while distinctions were improved from 49 999 to 61 887 in the same period, putting the province at number one in the country in achieving this feat. Mshengu said the six provincial schools that had a zero pass in 2020 had all moved away from that state. The mathematics pass rate has also improved from 51.2% to 54.2% in the same period, while physical science has improved from to 71.2%. Premier Sihle Zikalala said applauded the class of 2021 and warned parents and community members against dragging their children’s education into their feuds. Zikalala said 11 schools were still closed in Kwanyawo, Mkhambathini area due to an ongoing feud among different people and locations, and these were accompanied by threats to the lives of certain families and individuals. “The schools are still closed, and we have met with izinduna in the area [on Thursday]. We are also preparing to meet with izinduna to try and understand the underlying cause of the feud and finding possible solutions for the benefit of all. We urge parents and communities at large to stop being stumbling block to their children’s education,” said Zikalala.
