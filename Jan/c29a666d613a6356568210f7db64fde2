The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of scattered showers and thundershowers expected over already sodden parts of uThukela, Amajuba and uMgungundlovu areas in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday afternoon. The weather office said a significant amount of rainfall is expected over areas including Alfred Duma - Ladysmith, Dannhauser, Impendle, Inkosi Langalibalele - Estcourt, Inkosi Langalibalele - Sobabili, Mpofana - Giants Castle, Mpofana - Mooi River, Newcastle, Okhahlamba and uMngeni. Saws said high soil moisture due to recent amount of rainfall coupled with expected rain might lead to flash flooding over uThukela, Amajuba and uMgungundlovu areas on Wednesday. The weather conditions could lead to localised flooding and difficult driving conditions can be expected on dirt roads. People are urged to avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles
