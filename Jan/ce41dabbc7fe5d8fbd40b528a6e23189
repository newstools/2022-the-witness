A small group of former president Jacob Zuma's supporters have gathered at the Market Square just outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court to support him on Monday morning. Zuma's application to appeal an October ruling for his trial to be stopped started at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday. In October, Judge Piet Koen dismissed Zuma's application seeking the removal of the lead prosecutor in his arms deal criminal case, Billy Downer. Had Zuma's October application succeeded, the state's case against the former president would have collapsed. Zuma, who is being represented by Advocate Dali Mpofu, will file an application at the Supreme Court of Appeal should his application currently underway in the Pietermaritzburg High Court not succeed.
