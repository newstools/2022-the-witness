The KwaZulu-Natal provincial cabinet has resolved to keep Msunduzi Municipality under administration. The decision to keep Msunduzi and other seven municipalities in the province under administration was taken during a recent provincial cabinet meeting. According to KZN provincial government spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, Msunduzi and the other seven municipalities were still facing a number of challenges. “The municipalities, which include Mpofana, Msunduzi, Inkosi Langalibalele, uThukela, Umzinyathi, Abaqulusi, Mtubatuba and uMkhanyakude face serious financial difficulties, such as unfunded budgets, huge budget deficits, persistent power cut threats from Eskom, infrastructure and service delivery challenges. Some are besieged by instability and parallel structures, while others are engaged in perpetual legal battles other than focusing on service delivery,” he said. The provincial cabinet's decision, Mabaso said, was in the interests of the residents of the affected municipalities. “They will benefit from the support of the other spheres of government as prescribed by the Constitution. “The interventions are extended for until 30 April 2022, after which the necessary assessments review and considerations by the executive council will occur,” he said.
