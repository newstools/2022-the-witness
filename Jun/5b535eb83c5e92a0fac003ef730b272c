The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) said there would be a reduction on the number of lanes on the N3 between Ashburton and New England Road due to emergency pavement repairs from July 9. Sanral’s eastern region project manager, Jason Lowe, said the work that will be done includes patching of the slow lane and will be undertaken over several consecutive weekends from July 9 to September 19. He said each weekend closure will start at 2pm on Saturday afternoon and run until 4am on Monday morning. “The emergency pavement repairs are due to the deterioration of the road pavement under traffic loading and the delay in the commencement of the upgrade contract over this section,” said Lowe. He added the existing surfacing will be removed and replaced at periods when traffic flows are at its lowest in an attempt to minimise the effect on the travelling public. “Sanral would like to apologise to the motoring public for any inconvenience caused during the road closure. We appeal to road users to plan their trips accordingly, especially when accessing travel hubs such as the airports. We further appeal to road users to adhere to the road signs and speed limit when approaching and travelling through the construction site,” said Lowe. He said they will keep the travelling public updated on progress and changes. The closures and impact on lanes is anticipated as follows: September 9 July to 19: N3 northbound and southbound between Ashburton and New England Road: a. Two lane sections reduced to one lane from 14h00 on Saturday afternoons till 04h00 on Monday mornings. b. Three lane sections reduced to two lanes from 14h00 on Saturday afternoons till 04h00 on Monday mornings.
