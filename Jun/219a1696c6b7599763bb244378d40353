Disgruntled tow truck drivers caused a huge traffic blockade on the N3 Southbound, Pietermaritzburg, on Wednesday, as they embarked on a national protest. A group of tow truck drivers travelled in a convoy towards the Ashburton Bridge at about 40 kilometres per hour, blocking the whole freeway. A tow truck driver said the drivers are calling for insurance companies to pay them more. He said despite the fuel hike, they have been operating at the same rates as before the hike which makes businesses unsustainable. “The peaceful protest is taking place all over the country and we are all angry about this thing. We are not making a profit and that is why drivers and owners have decided to take to the streets. The protest is only going to be for today (Wednesday),” said the driver. Tow truck drivers also gathered in Durban where they blocked Queen Nandi Drive, in Inanda, resulting in slow-moving traffic.
