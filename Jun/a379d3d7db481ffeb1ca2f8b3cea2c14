The KZN Department of Transport has called for extra vigilance on the road after 11 people were killed over the weekend. In a statement released on Monday, the department said the 11 died in two major accidents. They also expressed disappointment at drivers’ behaviour and called for road users to be extra vigilant on the road. The department said the first accident happened on the P47 in Vryheid, near Mondlo, where five people died. “It was reported that an accident occurred between a bakkie and a light motor vehicle. Five occupants who are believed to be from a light motor vehicle succumbed to their injuries and died on the scene,” read the statement. Five more people died on the N3 in Cliffdale, between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. The other person died on the way to the hospital. “It is alleged that the accident occurred when the driver was trying to avoid another vehicle and lost control. “Upon a closer investigation police discovered that the occupants of the vehicle were copper thieves as an undisclosed amount of copper was found in their vehicle,” read the statement. Transport head of department Siboniso Mbhele condemned the behaviour by motorists and appealed to them to abide by the rule of law. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of so many people in one weekend ... We have commissioned investigations into both the accidents, and we believe that where action needs to be taken, [it] will be taken without hesitation. “The costs of these accidents to the economy are huge. We will continue to increase vigilance as schools are closed for the winter holidays,” said Mbhele.
