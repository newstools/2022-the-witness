A Durban teacher Nomusa Precious Gabuza was sentenced to three years of correctional supervision and four years imprisonment, wholly suspended for three years, for voting 24 times during 2021 municipal elections. Gabuza (37) pleaded guilty to contravention of the Local Government Municipal Electoral Act 2000. In her plea at the Umlazi Regional Court, she mentioned that she was a teacher at a school in Durban, which was also used as a voting station during the local government elections in November 2021. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) regional spokesperson, said Gabuza was the presiding officer at this voting station and acknowledged that her job was to ensure that the voting process was conducted fairly and justly, without any problems. “On the morning of the elections and before the voting station could open, she decided to cast extra votes in favour of her party of choice. “She said that she cast 24 votes, 12 for the municipal elections and 12 for the ward elections, in favour of her party and put them in the relevant boxes,” said Ramkisson-Kara. In her plea, Ramkisson-Kara said Gabuza mentioned that she did this knowing that her actions were wrong and that she was only entitled to vote once. She was arrested after a party representative inspected the boxes before the start of the voting process and found ballot papers. She eventually confessed.
