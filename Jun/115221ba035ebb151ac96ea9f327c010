KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, has opened a criminal case of assault and crimen injuria against former radio personality Ngizwe Mchunu. The pair allegedly had a go at each other on Saturday in one of the VVIP marquees during the Ingoma Kazwelonke Festival at Moses Mabhida Stadium, in Durban. In a Sunday statement, the provincial government alleged that there had been a series of recent episodes during which Mchunu hurled verbal abuse and invectives at the Zikalala without justification or provocation. Zikalal's spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, said on Saturday Mchunu allegedly came over to the exclusive area where the premier was seated, and started hurling insults at him. “As a result, people nearby had to intervene. With the aid of security personnel the premier had to leave the event.” As a public servant and private individual, Mabaso said Zikalala reserved all rights applicable to him in terms of the Constitution. “In this regard the Premier stands ready and is duty bound to exhaust all legal avenues to protect himself and the dignity of the office he occupies from unscrupulous and unwarranted attacks by individuals such as Mr Mchunu,” Mabaso said. It is also alleged that Mchunu has also open a counter assault case against Zikalala. Attempts to get comment from Mchunu were unsuccessful.
