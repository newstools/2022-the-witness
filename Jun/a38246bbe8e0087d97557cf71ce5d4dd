Police in KwaZulu-Natal have started putting measures in place after a video started doing its rounds again, calling for a national shutdown of police stations on June 16. The police in the province said they have noted the video, in which an individual threatens to close all police stations on June 16. In the video, seen by The Witness, Operation Dudula leader Nhlanhla Lux can be heard saying that on the day, they will come with lockers and chains to close all police stations in the country. Lux was speaking during an interview in a popular podcast show, Podcast and Chill. He said this was mainly because the police are drowning in corruption and the government doesn’t pay them enough, thus they are subjected to bribery. “We are going there as young people to lock and close them. If these police stations are not working for us, then lets close them. We are not destroying the police stations, we are closing them as an exercise to articulate a certain view. on June 16, no police station will open,” said Lux in the video. The KZN Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has condemned the circulation of the video. “While we are aware that this is an old video, we appeal to members of the public to refrain from circulating this video as this will be playing into the hands of mischievous individuals who clearly want to spread panic among the community. “We want to reassure the public that we will not allow anyone to close any police station in this province and we will act decisively if any attempts are made to disrupt services offered to the community at our police stations,” he said.
