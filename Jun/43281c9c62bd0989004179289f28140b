A blue wildebeest that has been wandering the streets of Howick in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands has been rescued. The Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (Wessa) confirmed that the blue wildebeest that escaped a few months ago from the uMngeni Valley Nature Reserve is back at the nature reserve. Sfundo Sibiya from Wessa said it had escaped to one of the neighbouring farms months ago, and they let it be. “We decided to bring it back to the nature reserve when it started going into town. The blue wildebeest is a very calm animal that doesn’t jump into cars like a kudu otherwise we would’ve immediately brought it back,” said Sibiya. He said they successfully sedated, treated and safely delivered it back into the reserve with the help of Wildlife Solutions and FreeMe. Residents said they were happy the animal was rescued before it was poached or injured. “I saw it running near KFC on Main Street on Friday. It was a beautiful sight but I was worried someone would harm it or that it would suddenly go missing. Howick is a really rich town in nature I was happy to see it but happier it has been brought back to safety,” said one of the residents, Mark Anderson.
