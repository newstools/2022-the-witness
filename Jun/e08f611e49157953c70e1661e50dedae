The body of 18-year-old Sanele Mncwabe, accused of stealing a cellphone, was discovered on an unpaved pathway in Nkangala, Inanda in KwaZulu-Natal, on Sunday morning. Reaction Unit South Africa’s (Rusa) spokesperson, Prem Balram, said they received a call for assistance just before 9.30 am after Mncwabe’s family found his body during a search. Balram said when medics examined the teenager’s body, they discovered that he had sustained blunt force trauma to his body. “According to his family, three of the deceased’s friends arrived at their residence in eMzinyathi - KZN [on Sunday] morning and [asked] if Mncwabe returned last night. “They informed his family that they were assaulted by members of the community after they were accused of stealing a cellphone. The three managed to escape however they were unable to locate Mncwabe thereafter. The boy’s family launched a search party and recovered his bruised and battered body in Nkangala – KZN,” he said. Balram said Mncwabe was a Grade 10 pupil at Magqibagqiba Secondary School in eMzinyathi.
