Two women have been arrested after they were found in a vehicle believed to be involved in a string of armed robberies, targeting pedestrians or students, in Pietermaritzburg. According to a statement by the Mi7 Special Threat Response Unit teams, on Tuesday night they spotted a police chase involving a white Mercedes and joined to help bring the suspected car to a stop. They added that the driver of the car entered a residential area in the lower CBD, where he lost control and crashed into an embarkment. “Three male suspects immediately fled the wreckage on foot and escaped arrest. Two females were found in the vehicle, both of whom were arrested,” read the statement. It turns out that police were patrolling the Woodlands area when they were flagged down by a person who reported that three men had just robbed him at gunpoint, while two women sat in the car laughing. “Police got a description of the vehicle and spotted it nearby when the chase ensued,” read the statement. The teams found three cell phones, bank cards, student cards and a firearm was also recovered inside the vehicle. Mi7 added that the two women were taken to the Mountain Rise Police Station. The vehicle was impounded.
