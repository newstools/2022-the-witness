Amid threats of a national shutdown on Friday, eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has put all metro police officers on standby. Kaunda has warned that any protest action must be lawful and peaceful, adding that those who may want to take advantage of the situation and break the law will face its full might. He said metro police officers are on standby to respond to any unlawful conduct that could destabilise the economy of the city and infringe on the rights of residents who are not part of the shutdown. Kaunda has also confirmed that the municipality remains open for its normal operations on Friday. “The city is still reeling from the effects of the recent floods. While we are all concerned about the price of petrol and disrupting businesses, shutting down the country is counterproductive. “It will reverse all the gains that we have made following disruptions related to Covid-19, the July unrest and the recent floods. The law will take its course in the event of anyone disregarding it,” said Kaunda.
