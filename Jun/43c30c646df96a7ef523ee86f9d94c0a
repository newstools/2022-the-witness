eThekwini’s Deputy Mayor Philani ‘PG’ Mavundla is frustrated by the slow pace of the government in providing relief to flood victims. Mavundla, who is also the chairperson of eThekwini’s human settlements and infrastructure committee, took to Facebook to air his grievances on the matter. Mavundla was particularly unhappy about Wednesday’s response from Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, who told Parliament that the R1 billion flood relief had not been disbursed yet by the National Treasury. Gondongwana said the governments of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape had not filed the proper documentation to access the funds. Mavundla disputed this, saying it was not true. He said: On Monday, during an eThekwini executive committee meeting, the municipality’s chief financial officer, Sandile Mnguni, said the metro had submitted documents to the Treasury for flood relief. In eThekwini’s 2022/23 budget, which was passed on Tuesday, the City committed to borrowing R1,5 billion that would be directed to flood relief. This loan, which was criticised by opposition parties in council, would be in addition to the anticipated funds from Treasury. Mavundla accused politicians of fighting “factional battles” with the lives of people. “All the victims that the president [Cyril Ramaphosa] visited in a biggest entourage, until today nothing has been done for those people and some even buried their relatives on their own. They are now calling us everyday for interventions,” he said. “We can’t be playing dirty politics with the lives of the people.” On Thursday, Mavundla visited the area of Mariannridge, which was hard hit by the April floods. The residents in the area complained about a lack of electricity and consistent running water over the past weeks. “Some areas are worse than others and in terms of how far the billion rand, if it ever came to our account, we would have gone far with it in helping people.”
