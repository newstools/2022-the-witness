The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has issued an alert for Tuesday's road closures due to the reconstruction of the slow lane on the N3, from Sanctuary Road to Link Road. Sanral said the contractor is scheduled to undertake works in the median drain on the southbound carriageway of the N3 at night on June 28. It said the current closure in the lanes has reduced the roadway to two lanes – only the middle and fast lanes are in use. Due to the site conditions and safety concerns, said the agency, there will be a different closures on the southbound carriageway: The agency said from 9.30pm to 10.30 pm, all traffic will be hampered while the contractor prepares to reduce the two lanes to the single middle lane closure. It said the Hilton on-ramp will also be closed so no vehicle will be allowed to access Hilton Avenue. From 10.30pm to 11.30pm, all heavy vehicles will be stopped at the compulsory stop at the arrestor bed area, and all light vehicles will be re-routed via Hilton off-ramp onto an alternative route. The heavy vehicles will be escorted in an orderly fashion down the middle lane from 11.30pm to 1.30am. From 1.30 am to 2am, traffic will be hampered while the road is being opened to two lanes and from 2am, onwards traffic should be fully open to both light and heavy vehicles with two lanes of traffic. Sanral said the alternate route to be used by light motor vehicles only during the closure of the road is old Howick Road (R103). Motorists travelling from Howick towards Pietermaritzburg, can take the Cedara off-ramp, and travel on Old Howick Rd to Athlone Circle, added Sanral.
