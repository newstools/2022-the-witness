There is slow moving traffic on the N3 Durban bound, by the Peter Brown intersection, as clean up operations are still ongoing from Thursday’s accident. According to a report released by the N3 Toll Concession before 11am, cars are being directed off the N3 route at Nottingham Road. “Expect delays. Please approach the area with caution,” reads the report. On Thursday night, an accident claimed the life of one truck driver. According to Zinhle Mngomezulu, KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, a crossborder truck suffered axle (a rod or shaft that rotates the wheels and supports the car’s weight) failure while on the road. Mngomezulu said other vehicles crashed into the truck, entrapping the crossborder driver under the rubble. The driver died at the scene. Mngomezulu said two trucks, a minibus taxi and a light motor vehicle were involved in the accident with a further two people suffering minor injuries. Mngomezulu said one of the trucks was carrying a large load of cement which spilled on the road.
