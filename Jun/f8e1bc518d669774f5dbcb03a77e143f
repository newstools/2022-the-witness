Traffic flow was normal in the Durban CBD and surroundings
on Friday morning. There was no sign of a possible shut down as anticipated
following social media posts threatening a shut down in protest against the
recent fuel hike. In an isolated incident what is believed to be students
attempted to loot a sportswear shop on West Street, in the Durban CBD, on
Thursday evening. The shop was still closed on Friday morning and it was quiet
in the area. It could not be immediately confirmed if the looters got
away with items from the store. A metro police officer, in one of their vehicles parked
further up the same street, said there were no signs of crowds which would be
an indication that something was brewing. Taxis and buses were operating as usual.
