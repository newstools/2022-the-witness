A second case of Monkeypox has been identified. This is according to a statement released by the Minister of Health Joe Phaahla on Tuesday, where he called for vigilance as the country recorded another positive case of monkeypox. “The second patient is a 32-year-old male from Cape Town, in the Western Cape Province, who has no travel history, which means that there is a high possibility of local transmission,” said Phaahla in the statement. He continued to urge the public to observe good hygiene practises and other preventative measures which proved to be effective against Covid-19 and other infectious diseases in order to prevent the spread of the virus. “The source and linkage of cases remain under investigation and the Department of Health are working together with the NICD constantly to assess the risk for local transmission in collaboration with the World Health Organisation in line with the international health regulations,” read the statement. Meanwhile, health officials are said to continue to closely monitor the situation and continue with contact tracing. Members of the public who experience symptoms similar to monkeypox have been urged to report to their nearest healthcare facility for early detection and successful treatment.
