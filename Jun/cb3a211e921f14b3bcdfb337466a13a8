On Thursday, Hollywoodbets Tuskers Cricket Team held a prayer session for former South African Under 19 bowler, Mondli Khumalo (20), who is in a coma following an assault on Saturday last week. Khumalo was assaulted outside a pub in England, where he was on an overseas stint as a professional player for North Petherton Cricket Club. The team was out celebrating a victory last weekend when the incident took place. He has undergone two operations after suffering severe bleeding from his brain and is in an induced coma. Efforts are being made to get his family to England, but they are finding it difficult to obtain passports. Pastor Jay Mannikam of One Life Church led a prayer for Khumalo at the Oval Cricket Ground. He prayed that Khumalo makes a speedy recovery, especially as he is his family’s breadwinner. Mannikam said: Those who would like to contribute towards Khumalo’s recovery can drop off items, such as food for his family, at the Oval Cricket Grounds during office hours.
