Disgruntled members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in KwaZulu-Natal are complaining about Eskom taking too long to resolve electricity problems. This comes after disgruntled community members gathered and blocked all access points to the Eskom Mkhondeni and Edendale offices in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday. According to a statement released by the union, which is the biggest in Eskom, KwaZulu-Natal, its members were trapped inside because the community was hostile. Meanwhile, full-time shop steward, Siyabonga Ngwenya, said that the response they got from Eskom was that there are illegal connections and that the load reduction is deployed in these communities which is the main frustration of the community members. “We call upon Eskom in KwaZulu-Natal to seize putting the lives of our members at risk by deploying this load reduction tactic to these hostile communities around KwaZulu-Natal. The load reduction tactic is inhumane to our communities, in the current state of the province which is dealing with floods and other ills due to high unemployment and the Covid-19 negative impacts. This provokes the communities in KwaZulu-Natal to target our members,” said Ngwenya in the statement. The union added that this is not the first time that Pietermaritzburg communities protested over electricity issues.
