As South Africans celebrated Youth Day on Thursday, a girl of about 15 years was found dead in Pietermaritzburg after 1 pm. Mi7 National Group’s Emergency Medical Services were dispatched to the scene after reports that a young girl was found in the bushes near Ohrtmann Road in the Willowton area. Group director Colin David said police were already at the scene when his team arrived. “Mi7 medics found police already on scene and were taken to the body, which was found by community members passing through. “On assessment, the girl, believed to be about 15 years old, was declared deceased by Mi7 medics. Police are carrying out further investigations. We pass our condolences to the loved ones of the deceased,” said David. Even though the cause of death is not known at this stage, a reliable source told The Witness that the girl was found by men who were passing by. “As everyone was standing there the body was not covered. She was semi-naked but there were no indication of any blood on her or near where she was lying. Only the police, after some examination, can tell if there were any injuries on her,” said the source.
