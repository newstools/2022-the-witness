A Pietermaritzburg woman, Nontuthuko Manqele (21), accused of kidnapping, strangling and throwing a child (4) into the Msunduzi River, has abandoned her bail application. Manqele appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, where it was expected that she would apply for bail. However, during the court appearance, Manqele told the court that she was not intending to apply for bail. Manqele was arrested on May 17 and is facing attempted murder and kidnapping charges. It is alleged that Manqele kidnapped, repeatedly strangled and threw the child into the river next to Alexandra Park, in Pietermaritzburg. She was arrested that afternoon. A large group of people protested outside the magistrate’s court, singing and holding posters, calling for her to be denied bail. After news that Manqele had abandoned her application, the protestors and the child’s family rejoiced. The matter was postponed to July 20 for further investigation.
