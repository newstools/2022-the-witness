One person has been confirmed dead in an accident on the Townhill N3 just after the Peter Brown bridge. Zinhle Mngomezulu, KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate Spokesperson, said preliminary information from the scene shows that a crossborder truck suffered axle (a rod or shaft that rotates the wheels and supports the car's weight) failure while on the road. Mngomezulu said other vehicles crashed into the truck, entrapping the crossborder driver under the rubble. The driver died at the scene. Mngomezulu said two trucks, a minibus taxi and a light motor vehicle were involved in the accident with a further two people suffering minor injuries. Mngomezulu said one of the trucks was carrying a large load of cement which spilled on the road. The route was closed and motorists have been advised to find alternative routes as the clean-up process is likely going to take a long time. This is the third big accident in this area in under a month. Three weeks ago a truck crashed into a taxi full of passengers and 16 people died. On Sunday, one person suffered serious injuries when a “runaway” truck crashed into another and resulted in a huge explosion. Msunduzi Ward 25 councillor, Michael Bond, who is also a member of the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) public liaison committee told The Witness that the roads on that stretch were too narrow due to ongoing construction works. Bond said better traffic management was needed in the area especially at night times. On Monday, The Witness sent a number of questions to SANRAL seeking clarity on what measures it has taken to improve road safety in the area. SANRAL has still not responded.
