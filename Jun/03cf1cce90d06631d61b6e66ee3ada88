The Pietermaritzburg High Court sentenced two men to 25 years and 15 years imprisonment respectively, after they pleaded guilty to the murder and robbery of Muziwakhe Zephroid Sibiya, in February 2022. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) spokesperson, said Sibiya was a principal, at a high school in Nongoma, where Sibonelo Prince Sikhakhane (30) was a teacher’s assistant. In his plea, Sikhakhane said that he was overworked and pressured at work and blamed Sibiya for this. Ramkisson-Kara said Sikhakhane eventually decided to resign and also planned his revenge on Sibiya. He enlisted the assistance of Philani Clifford Ntuli (36), who was his friend. “On the day of the offence, Sikhakhane phoned Sibiya, asking for a lift to Nongoma. Sibiya agreed and fetched him along with Ntuli. They were armed with a firearm.” While on the R66 main road, Sikhakhane said he needed to urinate and asked that Sibiya stops on the side of the road. “While Sikhakhane got off the car, Ntuli produced the firearm and fatally shot Sibiya in the chest. They stole his cellphone, tablet and laptop and fled on foot,” said Ramkisson-Kara. In court, Ramkisson-Kara said senior state advocate, Mbongeni Mthembu, handed a victim impact statement compiled by Sibiya’s brother. “In his statement, he said that Sibiya was a good person and the family relied on him, as he had a stable government job. They are now adversely affected by his death. The family misses him and they have all undergone counselling.” In sentencing, Ramkisson-Kara said the court deviated from the minimum sentence of life imprisonment because they had no previous or pending cases. The court also found them to be remorseful for their actions and eligible candidates for rehabilitation. They will serve an effective 25 years imprisonment as the sentences will run concurrently.
