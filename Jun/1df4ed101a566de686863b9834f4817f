Eskom has confirmed stage two load shedding from 5pm to 10pm on Monday night until Thursday. According to a statement released by the power group, this is due to the continued shortage of generation capacity. “The power utility currently has 5 232MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 202MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” read the statement. Eskom continued to urge the public to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items.
