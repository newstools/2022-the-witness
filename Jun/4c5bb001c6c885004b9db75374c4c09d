A man believed to a taxi driver was shot during an alleged robbery at Msalasini Taxi Rank, in Verulam, north of Durban on Saturday afternoon. According to the Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson, Prem Balram, the man had sustained a gunshot wound to his chest and right arm. “It is alleged that the deceased was seated alone in the minibus taxi when he was approached by the suspect who produced a firearm. The victim attempted to flee by jumping from his seat to the rear and exiting through the sliding door when two shots were fired. He collapsed a few metres away from the vehicle. The suspect fled with cash,” said Balram. He said the man was driven to the Reaction Unit headquarters by a person known to him to seek for medical help but he had died. Police were yet to comment.
