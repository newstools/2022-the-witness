Residents from KaXimba and surrounding areas outside Pietermaritzburg blocked the Eskom offices on the R103 in Cato Ridge with burning tyres on Monday morning demanding electricity. The residents had no electricity for days after a transformer exploded. Eskom spokesperson, Joyce Zingoni, said a transformer blew due to overloading. “Eskom requested to do audits in order to root out non-payers and illegal connections before they could repair or replace the transformer, but the community refused. The community then burnt some Eskom infrastructure, which further aggravated the damage,” said Zingoni. *This is a developing story.
