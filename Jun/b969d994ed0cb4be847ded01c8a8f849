Midlands residents on Wednesday morning had a bout of unexpected rain accompanied by hail. This comes after the South African Weather Services (Saws) warned the public of extremely cold weather conditions starting from Wednesday until the end of the week. Weather forecaster Thandiwe Gumede said two cold fronts were expected to pass through KwaZulu-Natal. She said one of the cold fronts passed through the province on Tuesday night and the second one is still passing through. She said the cold front is expected to be accompanied by cool conditions, thundershowers, which could be accompanied by hail, and strong winds. Gumede confirmed that light hail did fall in some parts of Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday morning but said there was no indication of hail falling in the Howick or Mpophomeni areas. She said they are not expecting snow to fall in KwaZulu-Natal, but it is possible in Lesotho and the Eastern Cape.
