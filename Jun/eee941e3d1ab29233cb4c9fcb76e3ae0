A 29-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder of a 13-year-old boy from Mbazwane in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. According to KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, Thobani Khambule was last seen on May 28. He was found beheaded and partially burnt in some bushes in the Mtanenkosi area of Mbazwana. She said police officers from Mbazwana worked around the clock to identify and apprehend the perpetrator. “Yesterday [Tuesday], a 29-year-old man was taken in for questioning after police received reports that he was last seen with the victim. Following this development in the investigation, police proceeded to an old abandoned house where the head of the victim was found in a pit toilet. “A bush knife that was used during the killing was also found by police. The motive for the killing remains unclear and the investigation is continuing. The suspect will appear before the Mbazwana Periodical Court tomorrow on a charge of murder,” she said. Gwala said this is heart-breaking to learn about the killing of an innocent child in such a brutal manner as we are celebrate Child Protection Week. “We are appealing to communities to play a more vital role in protecting our children. Any form of abuse directed at any child in our society should immediately be reported to the police or social workers.”
