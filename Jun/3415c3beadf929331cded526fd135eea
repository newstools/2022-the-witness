Eskom has warned South Africans of possible Stage 6 power cuts from 5 pm on Tuesday. Currently, the country is on Stage 4 load shedding. Speaking during an urgent media briefing on Tuesday morning where Eskom was giving an update on the power grid, Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter said it is necessary to warn the public that Stage 6 could be implemented from 5 pm on Tuesday afternoon due to a breakdown of power plants and the ongoing “unlawful industrial action” by Eskom workers. “We find ourselves in Stage 4 already. We have had a significant deterioration overnight. There is a very real risk of Stage 6 load shedding from peak tonight,” said De Ruyter. He said if they get more capacity back, they can avert Stage 6, but he stressed the risk is there.
