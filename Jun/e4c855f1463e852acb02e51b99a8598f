A man believed to be in his fifties died after being assaulted with wooden objects outside Taylor’s Halt Police Station in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday night. The man was a taxi driver. A reliable source said the man allegedly had an altercation with a passenger. “It is alleged the man was killed outside the police station while he was trying to get assistance from the police,” said the source. A statement by Mi7 National Group said the man was declared dead at the scene. They said when they arrived at the scene, police officers were still searching for the suspects, while the man was lying outside the station. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, sergeant Sifiso Gwala said it was alleged the taxi was coming from town to Taylor's Halt when two unknown men started an argument with the conductor over taxi fare. "Eventually the passengers paid their fare but the argument persisted until the driver decided to pass by the police station where he parked the taxi outside and went inside the police station. It is alleged the two passengers started damaging the windows of the taxi and other passengers got off and ran away. The driver was assaulted by wooden pieces and succumbed to his injuries on the back of his head," said Gwala. No arrests have been made. *This is a developing story.
