Snake rescuer Nick Evans has warned people not to kill Nile monitor lizards. This comes after he saved one that was injured and stuck in a factory in Durban, over the weekend. According to Evans, the lizard was trapped in between a wooden wall and a window, and he had to break the window to help get it out. “Once I had the lizard out, I could see it had an extremely nasty injury on the tail. Someone had apparently hit it three weeks ago, to try and prevent it from entering the factory. It managed anyway, and has been hiding in there for three weeks, in a lot of pain,” said Evans. He added that he took it to Dangerous Creatures at Ushaka Sea World (SAAMBR), so the veterinary team could check it out. “As expected, the tail was immediately amputated. It wasn’t too high up, closer to the end thankfully. They use their tails for swimming mostly. The tail had been healing well already, by itself. “It was given painkillers, and antibiotics if I recall. It had water and a meal too! It will be released shortly,” said Evans. According to Evans, these animals are constantly being killed for people to eat, and they’re also killed for traditional medicine (muthi). He added that these lizards are part of the threatened or protected species (TOPS) and that it is illegal to kill them.
