A Cramond farmer, Edward Philip Solomon (69), who was accused of killing a man during a funeral, was found guilty for murder and attempted murder. Solomon was convicted on Wednesday by the Pietermaritzburg High Court for the crimes committed in December 2017 on his farm in the Cramond area near New Hanover. Solomon had pleaded not guilty. He is charged with the murder of Mothi Jeffrey Ngubane and the attempted murder of Mondli Lembede on December 30, 2017. Solomon lived on the farm. Ngubane and Lembede lived in a homestead on the same property. On the day of the incident, Ngubane and Lembede were part of a funeral procession at the homestead when Solomon interrupted and asked mourners to leave the area. When they refused to do so, he fired a shot. Lembede was injured and Ngubane died. He then fled to his house. The KwaZulu-Natal’s National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said the matter was adjourned to October 3 for pre-sentencing reports. She said Solomon’s bail was cancelled and he will remain in custody.
