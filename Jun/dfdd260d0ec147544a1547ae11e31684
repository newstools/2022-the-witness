The body of a girl found in some bushes near Ohrtmann Road in the Willowton area last week has still not been identified. The girl, believed to be 15 years old, was found on Thursday by some men who were passing by. According to the Mi7 National Group’s director, Colin David, she was declared dead at the scene by Mi7 medics. A source told The Witness that the girl was found semi-naked, but there was no indication of blood on her or near where she was lying. Mountain Rise police spokesperson, warrant officer Panchael Singh, said a number of families had been to the station to find out about the body, but none of them could identify the girl. Ward councillor Suraya Reddy said the girl was wearing a grey hoodie jacket and a T-shirt with blue and yellow stripes.

The body was found in a place with a number of sex workers and it’s hard to tell whether she was one of them or was involved in any of the drug [use],” said Reddy. She added that the police made contact with her because they believed the girl was from the area. “They said it seemed the girl had not been on the street for long because she seemed well fed and her body weight was not the same as most of the girls on the street,” said Reddy.
