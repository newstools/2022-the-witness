A 41-year-old man was allegedly shot by a loan shark following a dispute over a loan payment in the Verulam CBD, KwaZulu-Natal, on Wednesday. Prem Balram, of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said they were called out to the scene after several business owners reported hearing gunshots. On arrival, they found a man lying on the pavement on Wick Street. “He explained that he borrowed R600 from a loan shark approximately two months ago which he paid back. “Yesterday [Tuesday] the loan shark contacted him telephonically for payment of his interest which amounted to R800. The man disputed the amount when the loan shark threatened to kill him. “This morning while walking to work, a silver Datsun Go… stopped next to him and two occupants alighted from the car and confronted the man. They attempted to force him into the vehicle but he resisted. “The driver then exited the vehicle and fired three shots at the man. One bullet struck him on his right thigh. The suspects then got back into the vehicle when the victim smashed the windshield with a brick,” said Balram. He said the driver was identified by the victim as the loan shark. He was then taken to hospital. Rusa said no arrests have been made.
