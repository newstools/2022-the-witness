Two men were killed and a woman was injured in two separate incidents in Buffelsdraai outside Durban on Sunday night. Spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa, Prem Balram, said their officers found a man in his thirties with four gunshot wounds on his head and body at his home. He died at the scene. “The second shooting occurred at a home approximately 50 meters away. It is alleged that a couple were asleep when two men forced their way into the house and opened fire on them. The female sustained gunshot wounds to both her hands,” said Balram. He added the man died at the scene from gunshot wounds. “He was shot twice on the head and twice on his back,” said Balram. The woman was sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.
