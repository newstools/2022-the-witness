The Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor in the Zululand District, Swelakhe Shelembe escaped with no injuries during what is believed to have been an assassination attempt. At least five bullets went through Shelembe’s car when unknown gunmen opened fire at him in Vryheid on Thursday evening. DA leader in KwaZulu-Natal Francois Rodgers said the party believes that this was an assassination attempt on Shelembe’s life and could have been motivated by a multi-party ethics committee report which he has recently been chairing in the Abaqulusi Local Municipality. The committee was looking into allegations of irregular expenditure by political leaders in the municipality. “While details are still being gathered, it appears that councillor Shelembe was being transported in his private vehicle by a municipal-assigned protector when unknown gunmen opened fire on his car. It is understood around five bullets penetrated the vehicle. Both councillor Shelembe and his protector survived the incident unhurt. Councillor Shelembe has recently been chairing a multi-party ethics committee in the Abaqalusi Municipality into allegations of irregular expenditure. The findings of the report were due to be tabled in the council in the coming days,” said Rodgers. He said it was clear to the DA that this “terrible” act against Shelembe was the work of powerful politicians and officials who wished to silence him and strike fear into councillors in order to protect themselves. “The DA calls on the South African Police Services to leave no stone unturned in finding the hitmen and those that ordered the hit, no matter how high up the political chain they may be,” he said. When contacted for comment, Shelembe was still shaken by the incident and referred The Witness to his party leadership.
