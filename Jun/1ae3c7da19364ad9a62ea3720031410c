The South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) has alerted the public to an intermittent full road closure of the N3 on Tuesday, June 21. According to a statement released by Corné Roux, Sanral’s Eastern Region Project Engineer of Pavement and Materials, this full closure is to enable the increase of the height of Eskom’s 88kV overhead powerlines crossing the N3. “The intermittent full closures will take place between the Camperdown and Lynnfield Park interchanges.” Roux said the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) will manage and monitor the diversion of traffic. Roux added that the road is scheduled to be closed at 10am to 10.30am for electrical cables to be lowered. The N3 will be reopened at 10.30 am to 10.50 am for heavy vehicles and closed again at 10.50 am to 11.20 am to string the first conductor. The N3 will be reopened again at 11.20 am to 11.40 am for heavy vehicles and closed at 11.40 am to 12.10 am to string the second conductor. It will be reopened again for heavy vehicles at 12.10 am to 12.30 am and closed at 12.30 am to 13.00 am to string the third conductor. The N3 will then be reopened again for heavy vehicles until 13.20 pm and closed again at 13.50 pm to complete stringing of earth cables. It will then be reopened for all vehicles. “Light motor vehicle traffic will be diverted via the R103 at the N3 Northbound Camperdown (Exit 57) off-ramp when driving towards Pietermaritzburg and N3 Southbound Lynnfield Park (Exit 65) off-ramp when driving towards Durban,” said Roux in the statement. Roux added that substantial delays will be experienced as the R103 is currently under stop/go operation due to emergency repairs. “The closure may need to be adjusted depending on weather conditions on the day. If that happens, a second notice with information of the new time will be issued,” said Roux. Motorists have been urged to use alternative routes as directed, plan and adjust their route trips on time and adhere to speed limits.
