Two men aged 36 and 33 are expected to appear before Umlazi Magistrate’s Court in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday for the murder of a taxi boss. It is alleged that on January 22, Simiso Gumede (36) was shot inside a supermarket at Amanzimtoti outside Durban. He died at the scene. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Thenjiswa Ngcobo, said the shoot-out started at a nearby garage. She said the two men handed themselves over to the police after they were advised to do so by their attorney. “They handed themselves in on June 9 when they realised that the Organised Crime and Special Investigations and Tracking Task Team was minimising their space and that the police were working around the clock to ensure that they are brought to book,” said Ngcobo. She added the two men first appeared in court on Friday and were remanded in custody.
