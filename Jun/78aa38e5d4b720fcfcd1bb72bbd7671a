Preparations for the peaceful protest demonstration by Cosatu on Friday are in full swing. The union will be demonstrating against the recent fuel hike, high cost of living, unemployment, poverty and poor wages. Cosatu KZN provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize said all Cosatu affiliates and alliance partners will join them in the demonstration as the current situation was an injury to all. Mkhize said the fuel hikes have led to the escalation of transport costs, which in turn has resulted in the increase in food prices and goods and services. Mkhize said the SACP, ANC, Young Communist League, Sasco, Sanco Youth, Taxi Drivers Union (Qina Mshayeli/Satdu), Cosatu Gender Structure and Cosatu Young Workers have all been roped in to participate in the demonstration. He said they have requested the presence of Premier Sihle Zikalala to accept their memorandum. The union will gather at Curries Fountain at 9 am and the motorcade will proceed to Marine Building in Dorothy Nyembe Street in Durban where a memorandum will be handed over at 12 noon.
