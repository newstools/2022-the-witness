With incidents of vigilantism linked to KZN’s rural community policing forum on the rise, the IFP has called on Community Safety MEC Peggy Nkonyeni to intervene. The forum, called IsiKebhe Community Forum, was launched in 2014 with the support of then community safety MEC, Willies Mchunu. Specialising in stock theft, the forum has, however, since apparently turned into a vigilante organisation. In the Nkandla Municipality’s ward 14, which incorporates the home of former president Jacob Zuma, members of the forum have been linked to three recent alleged murders. According to a community member who spoke on condition of anonymity, three people have been recently murdered after being suspected of stock theft. Nkandla Municipality ward 14 councillor Philani Nkwanyana said while it was true that there has been murders in the area, he did not know whether members of the forum were behind the murders. IFP KZN provincial community safety spokesperson Blessed Gwala said he was aware of the complaints that members of the forum have turned violent. “These complaints are not only from the Nkandla area but in many parts of the province,” he said. “When the forum was launched, there was an expectation that its members would receive basic training around the law. But that did not happen.” By late Sunday afternoon, MEC Nkonyeni was yet to respond to questions sent by The Witness on the IsiKebhe Community Forum matter.
