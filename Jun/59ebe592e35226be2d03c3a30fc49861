Former president Jacob Zuma’s backers made their way to his Nkandla homestead on Thursday afternoon for a prayer gathering as a show of support. The Zuma supporters, who planned to hold a prayer outside his home, want the ANC leadership to support him in his legal battles. Thami Dlamini, a Zuma supporter from the ANC Musa Dladla Region, said the prayer was part of a campaign to highlight the former president’s plight. “What is currently happening to president Zuma is very unfair. “He is supposed to be enjoying life with his family but elements within society, who hate the fact that he always speaks the truth about black poverty, are doing everything possible to ensure that he does not enjoy his retirement,” he said. Zuma is currently facing corruption charges in connection with his alleged role in the arms deal contract in the 1990s. The former president, who was released on medical parole after spending weeks in prison for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before the Zondo Commission, could be sent back to prison. This is after another court found that his September release from prison on medical parole was irregular. News24 previously reported that the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) is expected to hear Zuma’s appeal against a ruling on his release on medical parole in August. Meanwhile, Thursday’s prayer was supposed to start in the morning but was delayed due road blockages. A community from outside Eshowe blocked the road leading to Zuma’s Nkandla homestead. According to police, the protest had to do with traditional leadership disputes in the area.
