A 52-year-old man was seriously injured after he was allegedly hacked during an attempted hijacking in Tongaat in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) who spoke to the man after the incident, the man left his residence to buy bread from a service station when he was approached by an unknown car. “The occupants got into his silver Renault Scenic and drove him to Emona where they hacked him on his head with a cane knife. He has little recollection of the incident however he remembers disarming one of his attackers and grabbing the key to his vehicle. He drove himself to the Tongaat clinic,” said Prem Balram, spokesperson for Rusa. He added that the man suffered a laceration to the back of his head. Balram said the man was unable to confirm how many people had attacked him or the car they were driving.
