A 46-year-old traffic officer is expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Monday for perjury and defeating the ends of justice. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo, said the officer allegedly opened a false case at the Mariannhill Police Station on June 8. Ngcobo said the traffic officer allegedly reported that he was returning from work when he was approached by three unknown men outside his house in Savannah Park. He was held up by the men who demanded his service pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition. “During the investigation it was established that there were contradictions in the man’s statement. The complainant was re-interviewed and it was discovered that he had reported a false case. It was established by the investigating officer that he had lost his firearm and did not report the matter to his employer,” said Ngcobo. She added the traffic officer was then arrested and detained at the Mariannhill Police Station. “We are appealing to the members of the community to refrain from opening false cases. It is a criminal offence to lie under oath and those who do so will face the full might of the law,” said Ngcobo.
