Starting at 10 am on Saturday, runners still seeking to enter the 2022 Comrades Marathon down run can take up entry slots until month end. The first part of the Comrades substitution process — whereby runners could withdraw from and offer their entry up for substitution — ended on Tuesday. Aspirant runners can go online to www.comrades.com and get their entry in on a first-come-first-served basis. Only a limited number of entries are available so athletes are encouraged to enter as soon as possible. The substitution window period will close when the withdrawal cap has been reached, or on June 30. An admin fee of 15% of the entry fee will be deducted by the Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) from the withdrawing athlete. The CMA will then refund 85% of the entry fee to the withdrawing athlete who is successfully substituted. There will be no money or voucher exchange between athletes. The 95th Comrades Marathon will be the 47th down run on Sunday, August 28, 2022, starting at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall at 05h30 and ending 12 hours later at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, covering a 90,2 km distance.
