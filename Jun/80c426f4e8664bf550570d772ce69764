The Comedy Central Roast is a series of celebrity roast. Jokes are made about people on the panel and the main person to be roasted. Mbau will sit at the roast throne, while comedians and other African personalities sharpen their claws to roast her. The Comedy Central Roast of Khanyi Mbau live recording will be done in July and premier on Comedy Central Africa’s DStv Channel 122 and Showmax in August. Vice President of Comedy Central Africa, Dillon Khan, said they were excited to bring the laughs to Mzansi with their partner, Showmax, for The Comedy Central Roast of Khanyi Mbau. “After two years of the pandemic, we’re ready to feel the roasts and laugh in person and as such we’re committed to bringing the best in comic relief to African audiences,” said Khan. Apart from many things, Mbau has been trending for her role on Showmax’s drama series, The Wife, as Zandile. South Africans are already eager to watch Mbau being roasted for all the laughs brought by the show.
