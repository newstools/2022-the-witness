A Pietermaritzburg court has ordered a warrant of arrest be issued against former police officer, Sandile Mkhize, who is accused of killing his girlfriend. The order was made after yet another failure by Mkhize to appear in court for the 2019 murder. The former police constable is accused of shooting and killing an ANC Youth League (ANCYL) provincial executive committee member, Sindisiwe Ndlovu (34) in Thokozani, Cramond. Ndlovu was employed by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Arts and Culture at the time of her death. Mkhize handed himself over at the local police station after the alleged incident and was later released on bail. Mkhize has been accused, by Ndlovu’s family and ANCYL members, of intentionally delaying the court proceedings. All witnesses, including the investigating officers on the case were present in court on Tuesday for the start of his trial. The matter was postponed to June 21.
