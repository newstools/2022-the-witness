KwaZulu-Natal police have arrested four men aged between 40 and 59 in relation to the ongoing truck blockades on the N3. This was confirmed by the KZN Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker, who said that the four men were arrested for obstructing a National Route, damaging or interfering with essential infrastructure, and economic sabotage. This comes after local truck drivers embarked on a national strike against the employment of foreign nationals and blocked the N3 near Windy Corner, Van Reenen and northbound direction in the vicinity of N3 in Tweedie north of Howick. Naicker said more arrests can be expected as investigations progress. Naicker said the N3 at Van Reenen’s Pass has been reopened.
