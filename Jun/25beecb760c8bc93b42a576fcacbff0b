Eskom has urged the public to be aware that the power system will be very constrained on Tuesday evening and the next few days. According to the statement released by Eskom, should there be any further significant breakdowns, loadshedding may be required at short notice, most likely during the evening peak of 5pm to 11pm. “We currently have 3 307MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 844MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” read the statement. Eskom also added that should the shortage of generation capacity persist; the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of loadshedding over the coming weeks. “Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary,” read the statement. Eskom continued to urge the public to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items.
