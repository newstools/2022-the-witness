Magma Security and Investigation arrested 15 people for possession of copper blisters in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal. Shaheen Suleiman of Magma Security said the men were found with about 600 kg of copper blisters believed to have been stolen in January from a Transnet train. Suleiman said in January, a train that was transporting copper blisters was targeted in the Estcourt area. “The suspects stopped the train by tampering with the railway signals. During this theft, the suspects were throwing off copper blisters from the train. Only when the train reached its destination in Howick was the theft discovered,” said Suleiman. He said on Monday, members of a Magma team were patrolling between the forest and the railway line around Howick when they observed a suspicious bakkie parked in the forest. Suleiman said the security members approached the vehicle and were informed by three occupants that they were waiting for the women who were collecting firewood. “The members became suspicious of these occupants and decided to keep observation,” he said. The officers parked a distance away and entered the forest on foot where they came across 12 men in the forest busy loading a copper blister onto a trailer. All 15 men were detained at Prestbury SAPS and the vehicles were impounded.
