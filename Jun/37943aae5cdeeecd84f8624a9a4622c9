A rapist and house robber, Sanele Siyabonga Mbuso Sotobe Sibiya (37), was sentenced to 123 years imprisonment after he was convicted of a string of offences. Sibiya was sentenced by the Pietermaritzburg High Court (sitting in Scottburgh) on Wednesday for different crimes including housebreaking, theft, robbery, attempted rape, rape and attempted murder. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, National prosecuting Authority KZN Regional Spokesperson said Sibiya committed the offences in the Southport area of Port Shepstone, between March 2021, and February 2022. Ramkisson-Kara said the victims were either in their homes, on their way home or on their way to work when he attacked them, armed with a firearm. She said Sibiya stole the victims’ cellphones, and in the housebreaking count, he stole laptops, wallets, cash and luggage cases while the victims were asleep. He was arrested after he dropped his cellphone at one of the crime scenes and was traced in this way, said Ramkisson-Kara. In court, she said, State Advocate Dan Magwaza handed in victim impact statements, compiled by some of the victims. “The victims said that their experience has left them traumatised and they fear for their lives. While Sibiya was collectively sentenced to 123 years imprisonment, he will serve an effective sentence of 35 years, as some sentences were ordered to run concurrently,” she said. Ramkisson-Kara said the court ordered that he should only be eligible for parole after serving 20 years of his sentence
