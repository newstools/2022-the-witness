A Pietermaritzburg man (20) pleaded guilty to raping four children aged four, five, six and eight from the Imbali area. The man appeared in the Pietermaritzburg sexual offences court on Thursday before regional magistrate Estelle Goosen. According to the guilty plea, the man raped the four minors on the same day, May 14, 2021, at his homestead. In his guilty plea, the man told the court that he was depressed as his girlfriend had broken up with him and refused to take him back. He called each boy into his room on their own and raped them. They had been playing outside his home. He said: Regional court prosecutor, advocate Yashania Manickum, said the state also needed to get victim impact statements which will be presented before the court. The matter was then adjourned to July 20 for sentencing and for a report from a probation officer. Meanwhile, the same court handed a 37-year-old man a four-year suspended sentence for sexually assaulting a nine-year-old girl who was his neighbour. The man had called the girl to help with chores and she agreed. He then sexually assaulted her and was interrupted by her sister who was looking for her. Manickum said the man was an opportunist and he would have commited rape if he had not been interrupted.
