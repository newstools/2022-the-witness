KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for justice following the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was said to have been possessed by demons. The KwaNzimakhwe teenager was allegedly beaten up by a pastor and his congregants in the Ray Nkonyeni Local Municipality. Thozama Sonjica’s mother had visited her school to report that some children were taken by the congregants for exorcism. Khoza said: She expressed shock and disbelief at the gruesome action and said those who assaulted the children had clear intentions to inflict pain, not to drive the demons out of their bodies. “It is unfortunate that people who are supposed to protect children, including the church, got involved in such abuse, leading to the death of a child. We want to see all those involved in the assaults, torturing and brutal killing of children arrested,” she said. Khoza said the torturing of children by the church was very shocking, adding that she believed that the church was supposed to be a sanctuary for children. She said the parents of the victims had to undergo psychiatric evaluations to determine their competency to take care of children. The KwaNzimakwe Traditional Council leader, Inkosi Bhekizizwe Nzimakwe, said he was in pain after hearing about the incident, especially that those who knew about it kept quite. Nzimakwe said: Area councillor and Sonjica family spokesperson Mxolisi Jula said residents wanted to take the law into their hands. Had the pastor not been arrested last week, he would have been killed, he said Brigadier Jay Naicker said post-mortem results indicated that the first victim died due to injuries she sustained following a severe assault. “Charges of murder, attempted murder and assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm were opened and a 40-year-old man was arrested and charged. He will appearing before the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court [on Monday].”
