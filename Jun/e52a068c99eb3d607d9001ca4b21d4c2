The much anticipated Sardine Run has finally hit the KwaZulu-Natal shore after a number of nets were pulled at Margate, in the South Coast. According to the KZN Sharks Board Maritime Centre of Excellence, tons of sardines have been netted in the area. The board conducted an observation flight on Friday morning into the Eastern Cape waters to assess the movement of the sardine shoals. It said the water was still discoloured, ranging from 1-4m in KZN, with some areas still having zero visibility. The upper region of the Eastern Cape, from Mzamba to Goss Point, had a maximum of 2-3m visibility, with areas where mud was still being churned up from the seabed to the surface, said the Sharks Board. It said there was very little sardine related activity spotted in this area, apart from two very small pockets seen in the surf zone off the Wild Coast Sun. “We then started seeing decent purple shoals of sardines, from Waterfall Bluff scattered right through to Poenskop, just north of Port St Johns. These pockets were mostly seen along the shallow line between the backline and slightly offshore. There were approximately 40 pockets seen with one being a long thin piece about 400m long. Throughout this flight we had large pods of common and bottlenose dolphins. We also saw 18 humpback Whales and two Bryde’s whales,” said the Sharks Board From Port St Johns to Hole In The Wall, said Sharks Board, the sardine related activity was seen further offshore, with the majority of the Cape Gannets off Hluleka and Mtakatye. The next flight to East London is scheduled for June 21, however this is dependent on weather conditions, said the board.
