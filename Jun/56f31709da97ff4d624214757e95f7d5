The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of extremely high fire danger conditions expected over parts of uThukela, uMzinyathi and Amajuba districts, in KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday. The weather office said strong and gusty, westerly to north-westerly winds together with dry conditions over the north-western parts of KZN are expected Tuesday. “A combination of these weather conditions is conducive to veld fire development. The north-westerly winds are expected to reach speeds of about 35-40km/h. “Extremely high fire danger conditions are favourable for development and spread of fire which may result in reduced visibility which results in prolonged times for people travelling, damage to property, damage to vegetation, air and water pollution and loss of human and animal life,” warned Saws. Other areas expected to be affected in KZN include Afred Duma - Indaka, Alfred Duma - Ladysmith, Dannhauser, eDumbe, eMadlangeni, Endumeni, Inkosi Langalibalele - Estcourt, Msinga, Newcastle and Okhahlamba. Residents have been urged not to make fires in open areas or leave fires unattended. There is also a warning not to throw cigarette butts out of cars or in the open veld, and not to throw bottles in the veld as they can magnify the sun’s rays and start fires. In the case of a large fire, people are urged to report it immediately and move away from the area to allow professionals to deal with it. In cases where there is a shortage of water, sand can be used to control the fire.
