The KZN provincial government has committed to support the Mthembu family, near Ixopo, after seven family members died in a house fire this weekend. Seven people, including children, died when a fire engulfed their home during a traditional ceremony on Saturday. The province said the police are investigating the cause of the deaths, and what led to the fire. Bongekile Mthembu (37), Thobeka Mthembu (31), Noluthando Mthembu (9), Anathi Mthembu (9), Ayabonga Mthembu (7), Zanokuhle Methembu (two weeks old) and Onge Mthembu (2) died in the fire. On Tuesday, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, accompanied by MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza, Ugu District Mayor Phumlile Mthiyane and traditional leaders, visited the family. Zikalala said the fire had worsened what was already a dire economic situation for the Mthembu homestead. He said the family’s house had burned down, and it is clear that the family requires the support of government in rebuilding their home.
