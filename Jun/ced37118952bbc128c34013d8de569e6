Eskom will implement Stage 4 load shedding from 11 am on Friday until midnight, and again on Saturday and Sunday from 5 am until midnight. The power utility said it is compelled to take precautionary actions to conserve emergency generation reserves due to the ongoing unprotected labour action. “It is necessary to bolster emergency generation reserves to react to unforeseen circumstances, as well as to replenish emergency reserves to prepare for the week ahead. “This would help fill the generation deficit while dealing with generating units that may trip amid the disturbances and compensate for the inability to return generating units timeously to service.” While exploring possible solutions to unlock the deadlock with the unions, Eskom appealed to its labour partners and striking employees to embrace the higher purpose of putting the people of South Africa first, respect the law and desist from illegal and undemocratic conduct. Eskom has also cautioned the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. “Eskom continues to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. “We currently have 2 766MW on planned maintenance, while another 17 395MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “We would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially during these uncertain times on the power system,” said the power utility.
