The KZN Sharks board said that sardine related activity has since died down. This comes after they conducted an observation flight into the Eastern Cape waters to assess the movement of the sardine shoals thus far. According to a statement released by the KZN sharks board, the flight departed from Virginia Airport and turned at East London and the water was discoloured, from Virginia right through to East London, with patches of 2-meter visibility occasionally. “These conditions were probably due to the large swell over the weekend, which contributed to silt being churned up off the seabed,” read the statement. It continued to say that there were good numbers of common dolphin, with Terns feeding on the clean water line offshore, between Grosvenor and Mboyti in the Eastern Cape and that the gannet and dolphin activity increased again in the Coffee Bay to Wavecrest area and once again off the Kei River mouth. “However, the large concentrations of gannets seen a month ago seem to have disappeared for now and although some of the activity may have been sardine related, no actual sardine shoals were seen on this flight due to the poor water visibility. “Patches of fish oil were seen regularly but all further offshore. Hopefully the activity will improve once the sea settles, and the visibility improves,” read the statement. The head of operations of the KZNSB said that they will continue to update information on activity as and when flights have been completed. The next flight to East London is scheduled for the June 14; however, this is dependent on weather conditions.
