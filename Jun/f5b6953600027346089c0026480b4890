KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala and former radio personality
Ngizwe Mchunu have opened cases of alleged assault and crimen injuria against
each other. They allegedly had a go at each other on Saturday in one of
the VVIP marquees during the Ingoma Kazwelonke Festival In a statement released on Sunday, the provincial government
said there had been a series of recent episodes during which Mchunu allegedly
hurled invectives at Zikalala without justification or provocation. Zikalala’s spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, said on Saturday
that Mchunu allegedly came over to the reserved area where the premier was
seated, and started hurling insults at him. “... With the aid of security
personnel the premier had to leave the event.” As a public servant and private individual, the premier
reserves all rights applicable to him in terms of the Constitution. “In this regard, the premier stands ready and is duty-bound
to exhaust all legal avenues to protect himself and the dignity of the office
he occupies from unscrupulous and unwarranted attacks by individuals such as Mr
Mchunu,” said Mabaso. Speaking to the SABC yesterday, Mchunu said he was called by
Zikalala, who was sitting with other dignitaries. In his mind, said Mchunu, he thought Zikalala wanted to take
a picture with him or just to have a casual chat. “When I knelt down as a sign of respect, he asked me one
question and said Wangfunani wena? [what do you want from me?].” Mchunu said he was taken back by the question, so he looked
at Zikalala and when he was about to respond, “he hit me in front of everyone”. National police spokesperson Colonel Athlenda Mathe
confirmed that the police are investigating two cases that have been registered
at the Durban Central Police Station.
