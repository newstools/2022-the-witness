SANParks has condemned the behaviour of one of its employees who was caught on video driving recklessly at a lion sighting in Kruger National Park. In a video that is circulating on social media, a pride of lions and their cubs can be seen near Satara Rest Camp on the H1-3 road between the N’wanetsi Bridge and the H6 turnoff. The pride is being followed by a group of tourist vehicles when a park official speeds past the convoy and nearly runs over the lions. In a statement, SANParks said disciplinary action will be taken against the employee, following an internal investigation. SANParks also thanked the public for bringing the event to its attention. Commenting on the video shared on YouTube, Jamie Parsons said, “Surely he should be reported and sacked. Absolute disgrace of a ranger/warden.” Feli Dae said, “This makes me angry! Shame on them for being reckless with these magnificent lions. ”Angelo Sisam said, “That’s the reason why there should be no roads running through areas designated for wildlife, they should not be giving way for vehicles. It’s just sad and disgusting. You could see the concern on the lioness’s face for her cub.”
