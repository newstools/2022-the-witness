A decomposed body of a man was found in a bush along the M27 in the vicinity of Waterloo, KwaZulu-Natal, on Wednesday morning. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa’s (Rusa) spokesperson, said they were contacted by a passer-by just before 8.30am after he made the discovery. Balram said when reaction officers arrived in the area, they were led several metres down a steep embankment next to the road. “The body of a man was discovered among the dense vegetation. He was in an advanced stage of decomposition. “A blood-stained grey T-shirt, which appeared to have been ripped off, and a traditional weapon were located next to his body,” said Balram. He said the identity of the man could not be established.
