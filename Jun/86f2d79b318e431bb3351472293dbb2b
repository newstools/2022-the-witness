A beloved animal activist in the Scottburgh area, Johnny Koekemoer, died over the weekend. Koekemoer, who is also the co-founder of non-profit organisation ‘4 Paws and a Tale Animal rescue’ which assists neglected, abandoned, and abused animals in the area, was described as a lover of life and animals and a sports’ fanatic who had a wicked sense of humour. According to a statement released by the NPO, 4 Paws runs a feeding programme which provides for hundreds of dogs and cats daily; provides shelter and medical care; sterilisation programmes; rescue, rehabilitating and rehoming for animals every day. “In 2005, when we rescued our first dog, he fell into this role without thinking twice and spent many hours feeding and loving these sentient beings who were abandoned, neglected and abused,” said Koekemoer’s wife, Nicky Koekemoer. Koekemoer also worked at Scottburgh High School, as a handy man. The family has requested that people send donations to the NPO instead of flowers in memory of Koekemoer, to assist in enabling Koekemoer’s wife to continue running the organisation that is run solely on donations from the public. Some of the items that can be donated include dry food and tins of dog and cat food. “Blankets, old towels, linen and kennels which make for a much more comfortable sleeping area and provide shelter on sunny and rainy days for stray and township dogs, or flea and tick medication. “Alternatively, financial contributions are always welcome to cover medical and food bills, petrol and airtime used for home visits as well as vaccinations,” read the statement.
