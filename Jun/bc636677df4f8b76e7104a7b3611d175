Durban University of Technology’s Indumiso Campus in Pietermaritzburg closed after students protested against writing physical examinations. According to the institution, the violence erupted in the Midlands campus. The university said the students are demanding that all assessments be held online. As a result, said the institution, the group of protesters resorted to violent behaviour which has severely compromised the safety and security of the staff and students on the Indumiso Campus. “While the university cannot be bullied and threatened by this group who refuse to write physical exams, DUT has requested support and assistance from the police, who will be present on the Indumiso campus. Therefore, following the violent and criminal behaviour, we will be suspending operations on the Indumiso Campus with immediate effect,” said the institution. The institution also urged all staff and students to peacefully and urgently evacuate the campus. It said the temporary closure of the Indumiso campus will be until further notice and the academic programme will continue online. Furthermore, it said, if the violence does not end before midday on Wednesday, then the university will consider closing down the residences until further notice. “We urge the protesting group of students who are refusing to write exams to reassess their actions and behaviour and to stop the violence, to stop damaging property and to stop intimidating staff and non-protesting students,” said the university.
