Five people died after a light delivery van overturned on the N3, near Hammersdale, in KZN, on Sunday evening. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, Zinhle Mali said five other people were injured when a Vito van overturned near Hammarsdale. “The driver of the morgue-like van lost control when he tried to avoid another vehicle and it overturned. Bodies were flung across the roadway and that’s why we had a road closure. At the moment we are waiting for the SAPS top come and collect the bodies and do marking on the accident scene for the purposes of investigating the incident,” said Mali. By 7pm on Sunday evening, the N3 south bound lanes were still closed, and traffic had backed up from just before Camperdown to Pietermaritzburg. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokesperson, Robert McKenzie, said the injured were treated on the scene before being transported to the hospital. “EMS personnel responded to the accident scene but tragically five people were declared dead on the scene. The exact cause of the accident will be a subject of investigation by the police. The injured were rushed to hospital for further treatment,” said McKenzie. Meanwhile, Mckenzie said their paramedics responded to another crash where a bus overturned in Waterloo, Verulam. “Paramedics treated 35 patients at the scene...The majority of the patients had sustained minor injuries.” *This is a developing story
