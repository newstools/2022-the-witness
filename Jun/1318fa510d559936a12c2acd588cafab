The KwaZulu–Natal Department of Transport said it will be meeting with the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) on Friday following threats of a national shutdown. This comes after Santaco distanced themselves from the national shutdown. A statement they released said they never lobbied any organisation for a national shutdown and there was no plan to participate in any shutdown. They said they held the strongest view that there was an urgent intervention needed from government due to the fuel hikes. They said taxis will be operating normally in the province on Friday. MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Peggy Nkonyeni said the meeting will be to find mitigative measures, which will assist to reduce the impact of the ongoing petrol hikes on their transport operations. Nkonyeni said they welcome and commend the decision taken by Santaco not to participate in the shutdown. “Such a shutdown would have had undesirable implications in the province that is recovering from Covid-19, the July unrest, and the recent floods that have been experienced by the province. “Any mass action that will disrupt the economy will further harm our recovery efforts. As government we have agreed to meet with Santaco to discuss the impact of the petrol price hike and to look at possible interventions. All businesses will be open and public transport will be available. We will however monitor the situation very closely,” said Nkonyeni. The province has however placed the security cluster on high alert for any possible disruptions.
