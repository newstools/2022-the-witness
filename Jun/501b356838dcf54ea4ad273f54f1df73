The Department of Health said it is very concerned about allegations of an alleged baby switching incident in Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. This comes after a 17-year-old mother from Umlazi, south of Durban, was allegedly informed by nurses at Prince Mshiyeni Hospital that her baby was mistakenly switched with another in the hospital nursery in April. The 17-year-old was told that a baby who died in the hospital nursery must be hers. According to a statement released by the department, the matter has been investigated and disciplinary measures taken against implicated staff members. “The matter is being treated with due care, sensitivity and respect – particularly because both parents involved are under the age of 18, however hospital management are in regular contact with the affected families, and on hand to duly address any points of clarity,” read the statement. The department added that the hospital has offered counselling to both parties, which was delayed due to their need to focus on their studies as they were busy with academic examinations. “The results of the first DNA tests were communicated with both mothers and their families. On request by the mother of the deceased baby, we have conducted a second DNA test, the results of which are due on the 21st of June 2022,” read the statement. It added that it is important to note that the hospital delivers between 1100 and 1400 babies every month, which is the second highest in the country, and that the hospital is among those that were hardest hit by the floods, which occurred around the same time as this alleged incident.
