KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala, on Friday apologised to IFP founder, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for mocking the politician during a recent Children’s Parliament. Addressing young people gathered at the Children’s Parliament hosted by the KZN provincial government in eDumbe in the north of the province last month, Zikalala said Buthelezi spoke as if the IFP founder had “impaired speech”. The Premier then went on to mimic Buthelezi. During Friday’s Youth Parliament, members of the IFP Youth Brigade did not only demand that Zikalala apologise for ridiculing Buthelezi, but they also asked the KZN Provincial Legislature to also apologise for the incident. Delivering his speech at Thursday’s Youth Parliament, Zikalala said Buthelezi was an elder who deserved respect. “I hold the prime minister of the Zulu King, Misuzulu kaZwelithini in high regard. I would like to apologise unreservedly for the remarks made,” he said. Buthelezi, who is the parliamentary leader of the IFP in the National Assembly, told President Cyril Ramaphosa during last week’s Presidency Budget Vote that Zikalala had made fun of the IFP founder. “He even did a lively impersonation, encouraging the children of the Zulu Kingdom to mock the King’s prime minister. “What kind of a leader is that?” Buthelezi asked Ramaphosa.
