Almost a hundred disgruntled residents from Lions River in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal, were protesting outside Eskom offices in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday morning. Residents who have had no electricity and water for a week were demanding that Eskom restores their electricity. Ward councillor, Nkosinathi Mabaso, said that the speaker of uMngeni Municipality, Janis Holmes and councillor Sithembiso Nkuna and himself had a meeting with Eskom to discuss the issue and hopefully find solutions.  “Residents are here demonstrating their pain of having no electricity which led to having no water for a week now,” said Mabaso. While the councillors were inside the Eskom premises, residents blocked the main gate singing. Residents had been protesting since Saturday blocking the R103 road, just after the Mandela Capture Site. One of the residents who asked not to be named said they wanted Eskom to restore their electricity. “It has been a difficult week for us. Our children can’t go to school because there’s also no water,” said a resident.
