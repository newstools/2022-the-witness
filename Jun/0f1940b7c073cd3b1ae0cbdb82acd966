The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has called on all its branches to convene their branch general meetings (BGMs) no later June 30 to nominate delegates ahead of the July provincial elective conference. During a press briefing in Durban on Tuesday, party provincial secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli, said at least 50% of the branches have convened their BGMs to nominate their preferred delegates ahead of next month’s elective conference, which will be held in eThekwini. “The provincial executive committee (PEC) calls on all branches to hold their BGMs not later than the 30th June 2022 in order to qualify for a space in the provincial conference.” Ntuli said the PEC further agreed that the main content of the provincial conference would be the discussion documents released by the ANC’s national executive committee in preparation for the party’s upcoming national policy conference. “However, the PEC has directed the Provincial Working Committee to identify policy matters specific to KwaZulu-Natal which may not be covered by the current discussion documents for the conference to consider,” said Ntuli. He said the PEC received and discussed a detailed political overview presented by the ANC provincial chairperson, Sihle Zikalala, and the report of the provincial working which covered the day-to-day activities of the party. “These two reports formed the foundation of the discussion in the PEC, the highest authority of the ANC in between provincial conferences in KwaZulu-Natal,” he said. He said the PEC has also mandated the working committee to do everything possible to ensure that the ANC secure a decisive victory in the coming by-elections in Umdoni, Umfolozi, Umthonjaneni and Umvoti local municipalities. These by-elections are fundamental for the ANC to regain the lost ground since the November 2021 municipal and also to consolidate towards the next general elections taking place in 2024, he said.
