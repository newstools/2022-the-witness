It has been over 15 days since their daughter went missing, but the Mkhize family from Edendale still has hope. Sthandiwe Mkhize (pictured), aged 14, was last seen on June 5, when she was sent to Inchanga to drop a parcel off. She never returned home. According to her mother Masindi Mkhize, her daughter did arrive in Inchanga, dropped a parcel and took another parcel that she was supposed to bring back to Pietermaritzburg. “Our relatives from Inchanga where she went, called us and confirmed that she did arrive. The children from there also accompanied her to the taxi rank and she boarded a taxi. “She also informed me on Whatsapp just before 5 pm on the day that she was in a taxi coming back to Pietermaritzburg. “When we noticed that it was getting late and she was not arriving at home, we decided to call her and sent her messages but her cellphone was off,” she said. She added:  Mkhize said since her daughter’s disappearance her life has changed for the worse. “With all the stories that we always hear in the news of young children being kidnapped, raped and killed we do not know what to think anymore”. Mkhize said even though it has already been two weeks they still have hope that they will find her. Mountain Rise Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Panchael Julius Singh confirmed that a missing person’s case had been opened at their station.
