Two children from the Bunganeni area in Umhlabuyalingana, northern KwaZulu-Natal, were brutally murdered, allegedly by their mother. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza said in a statement on Wednesday that two children aged one and nine years old were allegedly murdered by their mother on Monday. It is alleged that the mother forced her older son to drink a poisonous substance while the toddler was strangled to death with a fence wire. The 26-year-old mother attempted to kill herself afterwards by drinking a poisonous substance, but was found alive and taken to hospital where she is under police guard. MEC Khoza said she is shocked by the incident. “We are taken aback by the brutal killing of innocent children. We would have preferred that the mother was able to share her challenges with social workers so that they can help her and her children. We are in so much pain for losing such innocent souls like this. “There is no justification or whatsoever for the mother’s act to kill her children like this,” she said. She added it was disheartening that many incidents of child abuse had been witnessed while government commemorated national Child Protection Week, from May 29 to June 5. She said during this time, they create awareness on children’s rights and advocate for their protection. “Protection of children is an everyday activity and acts of abusing and killing children will never be accepted by this government. We want to see all those involved in any form of child abuse get punished.” Khoza said the department had various programmes to ensure the protection of children, including removing them from dangerous places to be placed in alternative care, child and youth care centres. She further pleaded with the communities to play their roles to ensure that children were protected at all times. MEC Khoza dispatched a team of social workers to provide psycho-social support to the family and to pupils of the local school.
