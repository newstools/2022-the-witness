Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 6 load
shedding on Tuesday from 4 pm to 10 pm due to the ongoing “unlawful” industrial
action. The power utility said Stage 4 load shedding will then be
implemented from 10 pm until midnight. Loadshedding will then be reduced to Stage 2 until 5 am on
Wednesday morning. From 5 am until 4 pm on Wednesday load shedding will be
implemented at Stage 4. Loadshedding 6 will then again be implemented from 4 pm
until 10 pm on Wednesday. “This is due to the unlawful and unprotected labour action,
which has caused widespread disruption to Eskom’s power plants. “This has compelled Eskom to continue taking precautionary
measures to conserve generation capacity and safeguard plant from damage. There
is a high risk that the stage of load shedding may have to change at any time,
depending on the state of the plant,” said Eskom. The power utility said it will continue to closely monitor
the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. ‘We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of
the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch
off all non-essential items. “Three of the 10 generation units that had tripped during
the night have been returned to service. This, however, is still insufficient
to stave off the implementation of Stage 6 loadshedding for this evening and
tomorrow evening. “We currently have 3 218MW on planned maintenance, while
another 17 621MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “We would like to remind the public that loadshedding is
implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore
urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially
during these uncertain times on the power system,” said Eskom
