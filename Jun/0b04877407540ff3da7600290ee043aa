Students from uMgungundlovu Tvet College on Tuesday once again blocked Balhambra Way and Newholme Way in Northdale with burning tyres. The disgruntled students said they have not received their financial aid allowance for two months and said they were struggling to make ends meet. They said they are currently writing exams and some of them have been evicted from their rental places because they couldn’t pay rent. The president of the student representative council, Nomathemba Makhoba, said they had submitted their memorandum of demands to the Northdale campus manager on Monday. Makhoba said they gave the college 24 hours to respond. “We have not received any response from the college as yet and the protest is continuing,” said Makhoba. Responding to The Witness on Monday, uMgungundlovu Tvet College principal, Ntombi Ntshangase, confirmed the receipt of the student’s memorandum and said they were engaging with them for a solution. This is a developing story.
