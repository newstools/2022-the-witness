Pietermaritzburg and Durban residents better gear up and keep warm on Wednesday as the weather changes into a gloomier and colder one. This comes after the South African Weather Services warned the public of extremely cold weather conditions in the next day or two. According to weather forecaster Thandiwe Gumede, a cold front is approaching, but it is not as big as they had anticipated. “Pietermaritzburg will have cold conditions, and will be sitting at 20 degrees, with a 30% chance of rain on Wednesday,” said Gumede. She added that the system will go away and after that, there shouldn’t be any rain for Pietermaritzburg. “Durban on the other hand, will also experience the cold front on Wednesday and might still experience the aftermath of it on Thursday morning, followed by gushes of winds,” said Gumede. She added that there are no signs of snow, as the cold front is not as big as they expected it to be.
