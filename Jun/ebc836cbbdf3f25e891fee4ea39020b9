Four people were shot dead in two separate incidents in the KwaShange area, Pietermaritzburg, on Monday evening. The incident happened at around 7.30 pm. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Sifiso Gwala said in the first incident three people were killed, two women and one man. Thembani Maphumulo (31), his girlfriend Zinhle Khumalo and Thabile Maphumulo were at the Maphumulo residence when they were shot. He said a number of unknown people gained entrance into the house by cutting the burglar guards and breaking the aluminium door. “A man’s body was found lying in the yard with gunshot wounds all over his body, one woman was found in the kitchen with one gunshot wound, and another woman was shot twice. “The motive of the killing is still unknown at this stage,” he said. Gwala said when the unknown men left the Maphumulo residents, they went across the road where they shot Mandlenkosi Justice Mazibuko, who is a family friend of the people who had been killed. He was shot at the gate of his house. “It is not clear if he left the Maphumulo residence before the triple murder happened or if he ran away during the incident. “But these two incidents are believed to be connected.” Police are investigating.
