In what's believed to be an error on the Uber Eats food delivery app, people were able to order free KFC meals on Tuesday morning. Social networks were abuzz on Tuesday morning as people shared screenshots of how they were able to order free meals on the Uber Eats app and only paid the delivery fee. At around 9 am, the KFC restaurants had been removed from the app, making people believe it was an error and not a promotion. KFC and Uber Eats are yet to comment on the matter.
