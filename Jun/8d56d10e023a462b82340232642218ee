The South African Post Office (SAPO) has warned of a new scam designed to mislead members of the public to pay money into a fraudulent account and share credit card details with scammers. According to the SA Post Office, it has received several enquiries about the new scam. “The emails and SMS messages appear to originate from the Post Office when in fact they have no connection with the SA Post Office. “Clicking on the link in the message leads the user to a payment page where they are asked to deposit money into an account to ‘release’ a package. In several instances a form is included asking the (bank) card number and the CVV number on the back,” read the statement. The Post Office added that it would never ask for import duties or clearance fees in advance, saying that if there were customs fees payable on a parcel from abroad, the client paid the fees when they collected the parcel from the Post Office counter or when delivered by a Post Office driver. SAPO said that it would never requests bank account numbers or an online payment for customs duties. “The tracking number on the message is invalid when entered into the postal tracking website or refers to a parcel that was collected years ago and the website you land on after clicking is NOT the SA Post Office’s secure website,” said SAPO. According to the SA Post Office, customers are sent an SMS or a collection slip when there is a parcel waiting for collection at a post office branch and this parcel should be collected as soon as possible to make sure it is not returned to the sender. “Post Office branches have separate queues for different transactions, so if you collect a parcel you will go into a shorter, faster queue. An identity document is required to make sure the rightful owner collects the parcel,” read the statement. SAPO has urged the public to report all postal crimes to toll-free hotline on 0800 020 070.
