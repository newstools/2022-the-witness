Three people have been shot dead and one left injured in two separate incidents in Dambuza, Pietermaritzburg. These incidents happened in the early hours of Friday morning. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Sifiso Gwala said the first incident happened between 1 am and 2 am and the second incident happened just after 2 am. “In the first incident a couple was sleeping in their house when unknown men entered and shot both of them. “They also shot another man who was sleeping alone in another house in the same yard. The man survived and was taken to hospital,” he said. He said in the second incident, another couple was attacked but only the woman was shot dead. “An unknown man entered the house and pointed a firearm at both of them and demanded cellphones. He took two cellphones and a flat screen television and shot the woman dead,” he said. Gwala said police are investigating two cases of murder and attempted murder in the first incident and they are investigating a case of murder and robbery in the second incident. Ward councillor Shota Zuma said they are very shocked by the incident. He said he has contacted the KwaZulu-Natal MEC for community safety Peggy Nkonyeni to intervene. “This is just too much, we need interventions. Imagine people getting attacked in their homes where they thought they were safe. This shows that our community is not safe. “This is a huge loss for us. What is happening in Pietermaritzburg is getting out of hand. We want the law to take its cause and find these perpetrators,” he said.
