Sam Boucher, the man charged with the Oribi Village double murder, was caught by police while at a shop in Durban. According to a statement released by police on Saturday, Boucher was spotted by a police officer in the Bluff area, south of Durban, on June 14 around 2pm. “(The officer) noticed a man wearing a hoodie covering his head and wearing a mask. When he (Boucher) saw the police officer he dropped his head and walked into the shop. The officer became suspicious and alerted his colleague about his suspicions. He then followed the man inside the shop while his colleague stood guard at the entrance of the shop,” reads the statement. “When he approached the man who was at the till, he noticed that he was trying to avoid eye contact with him. The police identified the man as a wanted suspect for a double murder that was circulated recently.” Boucher was arrested at the spot by police and detained at Brighton Beach Police Station. Boucher appeared on Friday at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court where he is charged on two counts of murder, robbery and theft of a motor vehicle. It is alleged that on May 26, Boucher killed Rita Westpfaha (82) and her special needs daughter Carol Westpfaha (58) at their PMB home in Oribi Village. The two women were found dead by their neighbours. According to police, nothing was stolen from the house except the vehicle which was recovered in Amanzimtoti the day after the murder. Following the murder, Boucher’s family had circulated missing pictures of him on social media. Boucher is expected to appear again in court on Monday.
