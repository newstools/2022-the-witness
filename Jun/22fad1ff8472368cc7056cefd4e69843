Missing grade one pupil, Asanda Mkhize (6), was found with the bottom half of her body and one hand missing. Asanda was last seen on May 17 by her teacher leaving her classroom at Tshelihle Primary School in Clermont Township, Durban. Asanda’s family have been putting posters all over Facebook pleading for her to be found and returned home. Mandla Sithole, ANC’s Clermont constituency head, confirmed to The Witness that Asanda’s body was found on Tuesday night in Umdloti beach. “The bottom half of her body is missing along with one hand. A lot will be confirmed by police as investigations are still going on to confirm the exact cause of her death,” he said. Sithole said the family went to the police station on Wednesday morning to identify Asanda. Even though her body had started to decompose, Sithole said the family was positive it was Asanda. Sithole said he has been engaging with Asanda’s mother, Bahle Mkhize, and she was “in a terrible state.” “It is one thing to lose a child but to then find your child dead and in a state like this is an unimaginable pain,” he said. Sithole said the community of Clermont has been shocked by the gruesome nature of Asanda’s death. Many people in the community were helping to look for Asanda and there was hope that she would be found alive. “As a community we are shocked. Even when she was missing, we suspected that she was taken because she knew the route back home from school very well. “This thing of children being kidnapped, we used to only see it on television and newspapers, now that it has happened here we see the importance as a community to always know where our children are.” Sithole has called on police to act swiftly in finding the person or people behind Asanda’s death. Police are yet to comment.
