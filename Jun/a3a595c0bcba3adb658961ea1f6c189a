Magma Security and Investigation arrested 15 people for possession of copper blisters in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal. Shaheen Suleiman of Magma Security and Investigation said the men were found with about 600kgs of copper blisters believed to have been stolen during the theft which occurred during January from the Transnet railway train. Suleiman said in January, a Transnet railway train that was transporting copper blisters was targeted in the Estcourt area. “The suspects stopped the train by tampering with the railway signals. During this theft the suspects were throwing off copper blisters from the train. Only when the train reached its destination in Howick was the theft discovered,” said Suleiman. He said on Monday, members of the Magma Security and Investigation were patrolling between the forest and the railway line around Howick when they observed a suspicious bakkie parked in the forest. Suleiman said the security members approached the vehicle and were informed by three occupants that they were waiting for the women who were collecting firewood. “The members became suspicious of these occupants and decided to keep observation. They parked a distance away and entered the forest on foot where they came across twelve men in the forest busy loading a copper blister onto a trailer. All fifteen men were detained at Prestbury SAPS and the vehicles were impounded.
