Taxi drivers and owners fired shots in the air to disperse a crowd in Hammarsdale, Durban, that wanted to loot a mall on Thursday night. Smangele Shoba, a resident in Hammarsdale Unit 2, told The Witness that at around 9 pm about 100 people gathered near the Junction Mall. “They were burning tyres near the mall however they could not get close as there were police, private security and taxi owners and drivers who were guarding it,” she said. Shoba, whose aunt is a taxi owner, said there was a callout for all taxi owners in the area to guard the mall and the Boxer shopping centre in the area. These entities were targeted during the 2021 July unrest. “The crowd kept on getting bigger, there were even people with cars that had no number plates but the taxi owners kept on firing gunshots in the air to scare them away,” she said. Shoba said they spent the entire night, until dawn guarding the area. Nkosinathi Majola, Ward 6 councillor, condemned the attempts to loot the mall. “We spoke to them and told them this thing of looting businesses is not right, because they hurt the economy. The mall employs over 2000 people in the area so we need to protect it,” he said. Majola said the people attempting to loot were from the Mpumalanga township. At 7 am, Majola said things were operating smoothly in Hammersdale with stores getting ready to open and taxis operating.
