The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) announced on Friday that repairs to the section of the N2 over the uMhlanga River Bridge has been completed and all lanes have been opened to traffic. The section of the road was one of many that were destroyed by the latest KZN flood rains that wreaked havoc in the province. Sanral said the opening of the uMhlanga River Bridge is a positive indication that they are working hard to restore the national network back to its original condition before the devastating floods. Mabuyi Mhlanga, N2 programme manager at Sanral’s Eastern Region, said they are working with the provincial and municipal authorities in KZN to advance the rebuilding and rehabilitation work required to restore normality to the lives of the people in the province. “Repairs to the M4 and R102 which serve as alternative routes to the N2 are on top of the road repair priority list. We would like to thank the motorists for their patience during the rehabilitation period. Sanral is working hard to bring the situation back to normality,” said Mhlanga. The payment of toll fees at uThongathi and uMvoti plazas on the N2 toll route remain suspended following the Sanral board’s resolution. This suspension is meant to assist communities affected by the closure of alternative routes damaged by the floods.
