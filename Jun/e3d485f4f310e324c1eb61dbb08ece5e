The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) in KwaZulu-Natal supports the call for a national shutdown to protest against fuel hikes. Santaco’s provincial spokesperson, Mduduzi Makhunga, said the protest was not their idea but they were left with no option but to support it because of the current financial situation and ever-increasing diesel and petrol prices. “This [shut down] is not our brainchild but we feel the pinch. It is unfair for the same government that we voted for to just continue allowing issues that affect us to keep on escalating. This is affecting the [taxi] industry and it will definitely affect commuters because taxi fares will have to increase. “We have just been hit by Covid-19 and some businesses have had to fold, plus the relief government fund of R350 has not been for all citizens. If need be, let the country shut down. Enough is enough,” said Makhunga. It has been reported that the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) and some civic organisations have agreed to bring the country to a standstill on Friday in retaliation against fuel prices hikes. Makhunga said taxi fares were set to increase between June and July after the last week’s fuel hikes. A litre of 95-octane unleaded petrol increased by R2.33. Diesel and illuminating paraffin went up by R1.10 and R1.56 per litre respectively.
