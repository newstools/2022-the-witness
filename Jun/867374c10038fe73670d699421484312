Be responsible citizens who will not burn down your country when you protest. Be resilient in all respects. That was Premier Sihle Zikalala’s plea to the youth during the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government’s launch of a R100 million Youth Business Empowerment Fund on Thursday. The launch coincided with the June 16 commemoration which was held in Mtubatuba, Umkhanyakude District Municipality. Zikalala said through the Youth Business Empowerment Fund, the provincial government has created successful and thriving youth entrepreneurs who are changing the face of the economy in the province. The R100 million fund was announced during the state of the province address to support youth business enterprises. “KwaZulu-Natal is the first province to announce a dedicated fund for youth enterprise development in the country. The fund seeks to end the economic exclusion and marginalisation of black youth in the mainstream economy,” he said, adding: He said government was unambiguous that the KZN economy needed to be de-racialised and must reflect the demographics of the province, the majority of whom are black and young Africans. “Through the KwaZulu-Natal Growth Fund and Operation Vula, we are providing the necessary funding to support black enterprise development and to ignite an entrepreneurial revolution which holds the promise to create the millions of jobs that we need. We disbursed R69 million towards the Youth Empowerment Fund during the first round. Currently, the Province is finalising allocations of the second round at R50 million. “The third round which will be R100 million will be advertised before the end of the financial year,” he said. He said due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in 2020, the youth fund could not be disbursed, and the funds were rolled over to the 21/22 financial year. Zikalala urged the youth to remain disciplined and to be patriotic like the youth of 1976.
