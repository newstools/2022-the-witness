A man was found dead in an e-hailing car, which was riddled with bullets, in Amanzimtoti, KwaZulu-Natal, on Friday morning. Emer-G-med spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said just after 7am on Friday paramedics were called to Tacoma Road in Amanzimtoti after a car was seen obstructing the roadway with an unresponsive passenger seated in the front. “On closer inspection, the vehicle was noted to have bullet holes and the occupant, a male approximately thirty years of age, was found to have sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics,” he said. Van Reenen said the motive behind the shooting and the events preceding it are unclear and will form the subject of police investigations.
