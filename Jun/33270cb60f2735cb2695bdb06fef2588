Fidelity ADT has commended one of its armed response officers (ARO), Musa Dlamini, for his swift response and bravery after successfully capturing a suspected thief. According to Fidelity ADT spokesperson, Charnel Hattingh, a Peter Kerchhoff Street business owner recently contacted the company to advise that his premises had been broken into. “Camera footage revealed three suspects breaking into his business in the early hours of the morning. The suspects gained entry from the back of the property by breaking the security gate and door. They stole a generator, speakers, and several bottles of alcohol before fleeing. “The following day the business owner spotted one of the suspects and immediately contacted Fidelity ADT who immediately dispatched armed response officer (ARO) Musa Dlamini who arrived within minutes,” said Hattingh. Hattingh added that Dlamini conducted a patrol and soon came across the suspect who was apprehended and handed over for arrest to members of the Loop Street SAPS. “The suspect was questioned further and revealed where the stolen items had been hidden. All stolen items were recovered and returned to the business owner,” said Hattingh. She encouraged business owners to conduct regular security assessments in order to resolve any vulnerable or unprotected areas to deter opportunistic criminals. “Security technologies such as CCTV, outdoor beams and roof passives are often used to proactively prevent crime,” added Hattingh.
