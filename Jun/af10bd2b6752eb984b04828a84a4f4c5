Clean up operations are still ongoing on the N3 Durban bound following Sunday night’s fiery accident. The N3 Toll Concession said the traffic backlog starts from the Peter Brown off-ramp and extends to the Howick North /Tweedie interchange. “Expect delays. Please approach the area with caution,” said N3TC at 9am on Monday. On Sunday night, a run away truck travelling downhill from Hilton, crashed into another truck causing a massive explosion that was felt throughout the area. Two further trucks and a light motor vehicle were also involved in the crash, according to Zinhle Mali, the KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson. Mngomezulu said one of the trucks had been carrying a huge load of onions which spilled on the road. Russel Meiring, ER24 paramedics spokesperson, said only the truck driver of the runaway truck suffered injuries. “Medics found a man lying approximately 60 metres away from one truck. The man was assessed and found with several injuries, leaving him in a serious condition. The man was treated and immediately transported to a nearby hospital for urgent care,” he said. Police investigations are still ongoing to determine the cause of the crash.
