KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the arrest of the people involved in the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was said to have been possessed by demons. The girl from KwaNzimakhwe was allegedly beaten up by a pastor and his congregants in the Ray Nkonyeni Local Municipality. Thozama Sonjica’s mother visited her school to report that some children were taken by the congregants for exorcism. MEC Khoza said five children were held hostage from May 25 until May 29, and were allegedly beaten up by a local pastor, claiming to exorcise them of demons. “It is alleged that those involved in the assault and torturing of children attempted to conceal the death of Sonjica, including moving the surviving children to other rooms and eventually released them to their parents. The children were assaulted, beaten, had water and salt poured over their bodies and noses,” said Khoza. Khoza expressed her shock and disbelief at the gruesome action. She said those who assaulted the children had clear intentions to inflict pain, not to drive the alleged demons out of their bodies. “It is unfortunate that people who are supposed to protect children, including the church, got involved in such abuse, leading to the death of a child. We want to see all those involved in the assaults, torturing and brutal killing of children arrested,” she said. Khoza said the torturing of children by the church was very shocking. She added that she believed that the church was supposed to be a sanctuary for children. “We don’t believe that there is a parent that can take her children to a slaughterhouse. These children were tortured, beaten up while being tied up. The incident has caused us a lot of pain and we are concerned about the role played by parents. It is abnormal that one parent went to school to report that the deceased was taken to church to be prayed for,” she said.
