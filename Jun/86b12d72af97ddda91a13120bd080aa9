Two ER24 medics were robbed at gunpoint on the R510 between Mogwase and Rustenburg, in the North West province, while trying to resuscitate a patient on Tuesday night. Russel Meiring, ER24’s spokesperson, said the medics were busy transferring a critically ill patient along the R510 to his home from a hospital in Rustenburg when the patient’s vital signs began to diminish rapidly. “The crew pulled the ambulance off to the side of the road and immediately initiated CPR in an effort to revive the patient. “While treating the patient, three armed men approached the ambulance, pulled open the door and robbed the medics of their personal belongings, as well as the patient’s belongings,” he said. Meiring said an ER24 advanced life support paramedic who had been called earlier to render assistance to the resuscitation, stopped on the scene and noticed the ongoing robbery. He said the three armed men fled after seeing the arriving medic. “Despite the ordeal, the ER24 medics continued to perform CPR and advanced life support interventions on the patient. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital signs returned, and the patient was declared dead,” said Meiring. He said a case was opened at the Phokeng police station for further investigations. “ER24 condemns all attacks on emergency workers and asks that all incidents are reported to the local authorities. Trauma counselling has been offered to our ER24 staff for their well-being,” said Meiring.
