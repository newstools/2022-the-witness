A wanted suspect was shot dead in a shoot-out with police in Sahlumbe (Ematsheleni) village in Weenen, KwaZulu-Natal, early on Monday morning. Gauteng’s police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela has commended the multidisciplinary team which conducted a takedown operation in KZN at about 3 am on Monday in pursuit of Mbuso Ndabazovela Biyela – dubbed Gauteng’s most wanted suspect. Biyela is linked to eight cases including a murder of a police officer that occurred in October 2021. Brigadier Brenda Muridili, Gauteng’s police spokesperson, said the team that traced Biyela to Weenen, comprised of Gauteng’s members from serious and violent crimes (murder and robbery), tracking team, Soweto district crime intelligence, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal tactical response teams. “The team tactically approached the house where Biyela was hiding but when he spotted them, he started firing shots towards the members who were forced to retaliate.” Muridili said Biyela was shot dead in the shootout. She said none of the police officers were injured. An unlicensed firearm and ammunition were recovered in the house. Muridili said Biyela was previously arrested in both KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng for murder in August 2020 and October 2021 respectively but he managed to escape from lawful custody. “Biyela was positively linked to five Jabulani cases of murder that were committed between October 2021 and March 2022. He was further linked to a Lenasia December 2017 case of hijacking and, December 2017 case for possession of an unlicensed firearm as well as a KwaZulu-Natal August 2020 case of murder,” she said. On Sunday, May 29, the police in Gauteng issued a reward of up to R100 000 to anyone who can come forth with information that will lead to the arrest and conviction of Biyela. Gauteng’s Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, has commended the multi-disciplinary joint operation team that successfully “ensured the end of Biyela’s reign of terror.”
