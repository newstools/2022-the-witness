Twitter has been abuzz after Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa, defended the controversial multi-million rand flag project. The government wants to erect a flag at Freedom Park in Pretoria to the tune of R22 million. Speaking to eNCA’s JJ Tabane on Tuesday night, Mthethwa said the project is part of his department's mandate to foster social cohesion. “One of our mandates, as the department, is to transform the heritage landscape. “A formerly oppressed majority is a cultural minority in public spaces, and we can’t say it’s business as usual, something needs to be done.” Mthethwa said included in their mandate of transforming the heritage landscape, is the building of museums, building monuments and the changing of colonial and apartheid names. “The issue of the monumental flag must be understood from a broader context of deepening social cohesion in our country. “In the sense that, it is not an isolated flag, some years ago the department did research and the research findings is that the majority of people in South Africa are not familiar with national symbols,” said Mthethwa. South Africans took to twitter to share why they were not happy about the price tag attached to this SA flag. Moore Nkabanhle said, “That money should be used to address the dire social challenges faced by floods victims in KZN. Clear indication that the ANC is failing dismally to prioritise important issues faced by the community.” Letsoalo La Mmatau said, "Nathi Mthethwa and others in gov are not out of touch. They know they are dodgy, they expect the backlash for the terrible decisions they make, they just choose to prioritise their own gains. That R22m flag is a gateway for them to eat. And they don’t care about your disapproval.” Suntosh Pillay said, “Don't worry about Stellenbosch guys. After Nathi Mthethwa erects his R22 million flag, he says there will be unity in S.A. We must support the honourable minister in his quest to unite our divided land. Aloota Continua.”
