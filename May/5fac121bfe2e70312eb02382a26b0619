The 73-year-old farmer who went missing following a farm invasion in Canelands in the northern KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday was found dead on Thursday. Spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), Prem Balram said the man’s body was discovered in a cane field opposite his homestead in Canelands. “His body was recovered by a search team who were patrolling the cane fields. He appears to have been shot multiple times,” said Balram. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said a family member went to the farm to check on the farmer after she last spoke with him on Tuesday night. “When she arrived, she noticed the house keys were on the floor. Upon entering the house, she also noticed that the safe was open, cash and firearms that were inside were stolen. The safe keys were on the floor and the bakkie was also taken,” said Gwala. She said charges of house robbery and kidnapping are being investigated by Verulam police. An intense search was conducted by members of Rusa, members of the South African Police, community organisations and civilian volunteers on Wednesday and Thursday morning.
