An elderly woman is being praised for  rescuing a dog which had been caught in a snare in a bush Deborah Wigham (89) rescued the dog from a bush on Green Point Road in Ashburton, Pietermaritzburg, on Wednesday. According to her neighbour Cindy Boyd, the dog had been barking continuously for 24 hours and seemed to be in distress. “My neighbour heard this consistent barking coming from the bush and I told her to fetch my gardener to go with her. They found the dog in a snare and cut it free. “It was beside itself when it saw her, it knocked her over and she had a few scratches, but she is fine,” said Boyd. Boyd added that the dog then drank some water and ran off in the direction of its suspected home. The dog is suspected to have escaped from its home when it got caught in the snare in the bush.
