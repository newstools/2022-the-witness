An off-duty Durban police office who was shot and killed during a hijacking in Umbilo, Durban, last week will be laid to rest on Monday afternoon. The funeral of 52-year-old warrant officer Michael Jameson will be held at St Joseph’s Catholic Church on Florida Road at 2pm. The service will also be live streamed on the church’s YouTube channel. Jameson was picking up his daughter from a school in Umbilo on Wednesday last week when he noticed a hijacking in progress. He immediately placed himself on duty and responded to the incident. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Athlenda Mathe, said Jameson returned fire when the alleged hijackers started shooting and was shot and killed at the scene. The national commissioner of the SAPS, General Fannie Masemola, said police were working around the clock to apprehend those responsible for the murder. “He died a hero serving and protecting the people of this country. He indeed served with pride as he placed himself on duty and put the safety of his community before his own. Let me take this opportunity to pay gratitude to the deceased member. “The bell has rung, thank you for your service and dedication to serve and protect. We will not rest until the late member’s killers are traced and apprehended to answer to this callous act.” The two vehicles including the one that was hijacked outside the school and another that was hijacked in Hammarsdale by the pair were found abandoned. This after they crashed both vehicles as they were evading arrest. She said the police in the province have since mobilised all resources to track and trace down the hijackers.
