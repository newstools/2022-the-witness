Eskom has announced that stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented again from 5pm to 10pm on Thursday night due to continued constraints on the power system. According to a statement released by Eskom, a generating unit at Lethabo Power Station was taken offline for repairs. One generation unit each at Kusile and Tutuka power stations were returned to service and a generation unit each at Matimba and Tutuka power stations are expected to return to service on Thursday afternoon. “We currently have 2 379MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 365MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” read the statement.
