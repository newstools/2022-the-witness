Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding
from 5 pm to 10 pm on Monday night. The power utility said this is due to the breakdown of a
generation unit each at Majuba and Medupi power stations on Monday. “Three generation units are expected to return to service by
this evening [Monday], which will ramp up through the night. “We currently have 2 246MW on planned maintenance, while
another 15 847MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” said Eskom. The power utility has also cautioned the public that as the
shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be
constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. South Africans are urged to continue using electricity
sparingly especially between 5 am to 9 am, and 4 pm to 10 pm.
