A family in Mpumalanga Township, Hammarsdale, is grateful that their missing three-week-old baby, who was allegedly kidnapped on Tuesday afternoon has been found. The baby’s uncle, Tebogo Msiya, said the baby was found on Wednesday morning after he received information about the woman who had allegedly kidnapped the baby. He said that the baby was kidnapped from the Home Affairs offices in the area. He was with his aunt at the time. “This woman was also in a queue and they [the aunt and kidnapper] started talking and became friendly with each other. She then asked to hold the baby and then disappeared,” said Msiya. He said when he received a call informing him about the baby being kidnapped, he posted the picture of the baby on a community Facebook page asking for assistance. The family also reported the case to the police. He added one of his friends contacted him later that day and told him a woman arrived at Unit 6 with a baby and that he was suspicious because no one had seen her pregnant. “My friend then asked for more details and I sent him the picture of the baby. It turned out the woman he saw was the same woman who stole my sister’s baby.
