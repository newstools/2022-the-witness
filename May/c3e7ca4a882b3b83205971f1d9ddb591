Hiltonians are mourning the tragic passing of a matric pupil, Oyisa Pupuma, who died in a car accident on Saturday evening. This comes after Hilton College, near Pietermaritzburg, KZN, announced the tragedy in a statement. “The sudden loss of a personality that has given us great energy, kindness, humility and humour is shattering,” read the statement. Pupuma was described as a spirited champion of the arts, who played major roles in Hilton’s Joseph musical and the Funk performances. He was recently cast as a lead role in Hilton College's upcoming production of The Tempest. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all Oyisa’s friends and family at this time, especially his parents Dr Xanti Pupuma and Dr Noluthando Pupuma, his McKenzie House brothers and Hilton staff members who have worked closely with him,” said the college.
