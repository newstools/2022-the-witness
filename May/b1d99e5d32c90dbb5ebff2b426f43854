KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the weekend rains were a setback to the government's efforts to rebuild and repair the damage caused by last month's floods. Zikalala said that even though there were no casualties reported, a body was found on a riverbank in Phoenix. “We want to believe that it's a victim of the floods,” said Zikalala on Monday. Businesses left counting costs after devastating floods in Durban Insurance pay-outs are the only hope for businesses that were affected by the weekend's KZN floods. The provincial government on the other hand was dealt a huge setback as recent repairs to the infrastructure damaged by the April floods were eroded over the weekend. Umdloti businessman, Roger Downes of Umdloti Letting and Sales said the recent floods had a devastating impact to the area. Downes blamed the damage to the drive-in into his business on people who did not protect the environment. The tar road to his business place was completely washed away. “The soil is easily eroded because developers and individuals do not rehabilitate the environment once they were done with any development they were engaged in. The soil is easily eroded because there is no foliage to protect it. This is very frustrating because we are in this situation because of people who are not caring for the environment,” said Downes. He said he was hoping that insurance companies would come through for those affected. The Umdloti Water Treatment plant which was in the process of being repaired following last month's floods, was damaged again. On South Beach Road, the floods left a gaping sinkhole which separated it from the adjoining roads.
