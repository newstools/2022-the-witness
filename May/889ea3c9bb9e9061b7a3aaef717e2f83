The SA Post Office has temporarily suspended the air mail service to China, as air connections to China are currently not available owing to travel restrictions. Parts of China are currently in lockdown to reduce the spread of Covid-19. However, surface mail to China remains available. The SA Post Office said air mail service to Malta and Luxembourg has been introduced, and the Post Office now offers an air mail service to 34 countries and surface mail to 51 countries. The SA Post Office urged people who order items from other countries to include their cell phone number with their address details so that the Post Office is able to send them an SMS when the item is ready for collection. On Wednesday, the SA Post Office said, “Customers who send items to other countries must make sure they do not send anything that is not allowed in the mail, which includes any arms, ammunition, explosives, liquids or items that could break and leak. No plant or animal material may be sent to other countries. Mail is transported in bulk, which means that customers should take care when packing items for dispatch abroad.” For further details visit the SARS website at https://www.sars.gov.za/customs-and-excise/sending-or-receiving-goods-in-the-post/
