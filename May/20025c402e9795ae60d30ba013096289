A woman and her daughter were found dead with gunshot wounds at their home in Oribi Village, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday evening. Neighbours who spoke to The Witness said they became suspicious when they saw the gate opened with no car inside. When they went to check, they said they found the woman, who’s in her 70s, and her daughter, who’s in her 50s, dead with blood on the floor. “I thought it was strange that her lights were on, and the gate was opened but there was no car. I knocked loud but there was no answer and decided to open the door. I first saw the mother’s legs on the floor and when I opened the door further, I saw her daughter also on the floor,” said a neighbour who asked not to be named. The neighbour said the daughter was lying next to a pool of blood and only had her top on. She said they immediately called the police. The other neighbours said they could not sleep properly on Thursday and were still in shock and scared. *This is a developing story.
