Three people were arrested after they were caught transporting a stolen Vodacom tower generator on Monday in KwaZulu-Natal. Shaheen Suleiman, from Magma security group, said they received information just before 9.30pm about a bakkie travelling along the N3 from Durban towards Pietermaritzburg, which was carrying a generator allegedly stolen from a Vodacom tower. Suleiman said the bakkie was then stopped along the R103 by members from Mi7 and Magma. “Three suspects were arrested on the scene [and were] then handed over to members of Alexandra Road SAPS [in Pietermaritzburg],” said Suleiman.
