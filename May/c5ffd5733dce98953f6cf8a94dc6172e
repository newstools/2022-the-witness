Stage two loadshedding will be implemented again from 5pm to 10pm on Tuesday. According to a statement released by Eskom, there is a possibility of higher stages should more breakdowns occur during the day. Eskom also added that the onset of winter has seen an increased demand, and this will lead to severe capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. “A generation unit each at the Kusile and Arnot power stations are expected to return to service this afternoon. “Since yesterday evening, a unit each at Arnot, Grootvlei and Matla power stations either tripped or were taken offline for repairs. At the same time two units were returned to service; one each at Kriel and Grootvlei power stations,” read the statement. Eskom said it currently has 3 049MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 762MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. The company continued to urge the public to use electricity sparingly especially between 5am to 9am in the mornings and 4pm to 10pm in the evenings.
