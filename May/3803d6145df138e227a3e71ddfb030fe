Msunduzi residents have been urged not to take chances and cross low level bridges as they continued to remain flooded on Sunday morning. The municipality’s traffic authorities said rivers and streams had risen, thus crossing swollen rivers and overflowing bridges was dangerous. These are found on Grimpthorpe Road, Woodhouse Road by Sobantu, Masons Mill, Willowfountain, Smero, and Henley village Assistant Traffic Superintendent at Msunduzi Municipality, Bheki Xulu, said the Edendale Road, next to Durban University of Technology’s Indumiso Campus, was waterlogged. “We also want to urge residents that they should not even attempt to cross Sobantu Bridge, Henley and Grimthorpe, as they are worse affected and are very dangerous now. “For Henley village residents, we urged them to please rather use the Sweetwater routes, or stay at home rather than attempting to use that low level bridge,” he said. Xulu said there were also a number of roads in the Pietermaritzburg CBD and other parts of the city that were experiencing huge water log issues. “We are also checking Willowfountain as there are two low level bridges that we are monitoring. The water level in rivers is extremely high as water is on the banks. Fortunately, we are yet to report an incident where there was a car washed away or crash,” said Xulu. He urged drivers to drive with caution so that they would be able to avoid colliding with vehicles that were drifting and sliding on the roads. He said constant monitoring was being conducted by the traffic authorities and the Msunduzi Disaster Management teams were also on high alert.
