Roads leading to the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court were closed on Monday morning ahead of the appearance of three suspects arrested in connection with Hillary Gardee’s murder. According to reports, the first suspect arrested in the murder is an ANC Mpumalanga office employee. Gardee was the daughter of former EFF secretary general Godrich Gardee. She went missing on Friday, April 29 and her body was found abandoned outside of Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, a few days later. On Monday scores of EFF supporters gathered outside the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court in support of Hillary Gardee, singing and chanting with placards in hand. The three suspects refused to apply for bail and the case has been postponed to June 9 for further investigations.
