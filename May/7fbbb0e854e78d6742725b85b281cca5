Dramatic scenes played out at an U16 rugby match between Northwood High and Kearsney College over the weekend. A video has gone viral on Twitter of a parent manhandling a schoolboy on the rugby field. It is alleged that the parent let his emotions get the best of him after what he believed that his son's team was cheated. The video shows the parent grabbing a Kearsney College player from behind, which sparked outrage from those nearby. Tweeps caught sight of the video and tweeted their opinions regarding the issue, with many saying that parents should not take schools games too seriously. They cited that it was not a rugby world cup but a high school match.
