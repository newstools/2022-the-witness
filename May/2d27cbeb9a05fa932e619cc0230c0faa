Hundreds of people gathered at Thursday's auction at Alexandra police station in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, to bid for items looted during the July unrest. Some community members were unable to participate in the auction after the registration closed before they could register. The items that were being auctioned were recovered by the police after they were looted during the civil unrest in July 2021. The items included fridges, televisions, washing machines, beds and other household appliances. The auction started at 10 am. About 200 people had initially shown up during registration, but when the auction started the numbers started to decrease.
