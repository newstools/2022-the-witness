A section of the N2 northbound carriageway between Umzinto and Umgababa, is still to undergo engineering inspection before it is open to traffic. The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) distanced itself from reports that Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula will be conducting the opening of the road on May 27. The route has been closed as a result of the April floods. Dumisani Nkabinde, Sanral’s eastern regional manager the road was never opened officially because Sanral did not give clearance. “Therefore, the allegations that the minister of transport is coming were not formally communicated by Sanral,” he said. Sanral’s spokesperson Vusi Mona said: “We distance ourselves from any communication to the effect that the road was opened and then closed because it needed to be officially opened by the minister. “The truth is it was closed because our engineering colleagues had not yet approved it opening for traffic. The minister had absolutely nothing to do with the short-lived opening and thereafter closure of the road.” Mona said that as soon as the engineering requirements are done, the road will be open to traffic. “If and when the minister visits the road, he will find it already operating,” he said.
