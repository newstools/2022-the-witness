Uber has partnered with Vhuthu Culture, an NPO based in KZN, to help distribute food and supplies that will be donated to those in need following the devastating KZN floods. Uber is also calling on the public to donate essential items using the Uber app. According to a statement released by Uber South Africa’s head of communications, Mpho Sebelebele, they want to use their platform to aid in humanitarian efforts. “We hope that it will help those affected to restore and rebuild, while honouring the memories of their loved ones who have passed on. “From Wednesday, May 4, users can request a trip using the Uber app and a driver will come to their doorstep, pick up their donations and deliver them directly to the Vhuthu Culture Centre in Durban,” said Sebelebele in the statement. Vhuthu Culture is responsible for ensuring that the donated items reach those in need as quickly as possible. Essential items needed include blankets, general toiletries and household items, baby products (formula, nappies, baby food), adult and children’s clothing, sanitary pads, animal blankets and food, school clothes, stationery, and non-perishable food items. Meanwhile, users of the Uber eats app can donate items purchased via the Uber eats app from the Game store located at Westwood Mall, Durban, until May 11. “Users must ensure that the drop off location of such an order is set to 70 Holmleigh Road, Durban West. Uber Eats will donate R30 for every order amounting to R150 or more,” read the statement. The donations will be sent to Vhuthu Culture, who will be distributing goods to KZN communities in need. Uber added that every donation, regardless of the size, will make a huge difference to those affected and has encouraged users to tip the drivers.
