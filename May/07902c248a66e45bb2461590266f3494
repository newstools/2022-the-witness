A 35-year-old woman was stabbed on her leg during an alleged kidnapping on Friday in Phoenix outside Durban. Spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), Prem Balram, said the woman said she was on her way to the bank to make a deposit for her employer when she was accosted by two unknown men who forced her into a car. “The kidnappers then allegedly drugged her after placing a cloth with a chemical over her mouth and nose. She allegedly woke up the following morning at approximately 4.30am and found that she was locked in a garage. Her legs were bound with tape,” said Balram. He added the woman found her handbag with her cell phone and sent a message to her employer. The money she was sent to deposit was however missing. “The kidnappers allegedly returned in the afternoon and threatened to kill her if she provided information to anyone with regards to the incident. She was then blindfolded and loaded into a vehicle. Her kidnappers stabbed her twice on her legs before dropping her off on Old North Coast Road in Durban. Rusa medics examined her and found that she sustained two stab wounds to her legs and bruising to her hands and body. She was treated for her injuries on the scene before being transported to the hospital.
