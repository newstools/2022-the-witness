Over 70 people were injured after a bus they were travelling in overturned on the N2 Umhlali River bridge, near Ballito, in the early hours of Monday morning. According to IPSS Medical Rescue, the bus was carrying wedding guests from Umzimkhulu to Nongoma, when it collided with the concrete barriers and overturned. “Our paramedics worked to stabilise one critically injured passenger who was partially entrapped under the bus whilst the KwaDukuza Municipality fire used the jaws of life to free her,” said IPSS’ Dylan Meyrick in the statement. Two people were seriously injured, seven moderately injured and 66 suffered minor injuries. The cause of the crash was unknown at the time of publication. On Sunday IPSS issued a warning to motorists to be vigilant while travelling on N2 through the detour near the Umhlali River Bridge. This came after IPSS Medical Rescue attended two accidents on Saturday night where vehicles had struck the concrete barriers.
