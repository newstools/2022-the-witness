Eskom plans to implement stage 2 load shedding on Sunday evening. According to a statement released by Eskom, Sunday’s load shedding will be implemented between 5pm and 10pm. On Monday, the power utility will move to stage 3 load shedding and this will continue until Tuesday evening. For the rest of the week, load shedding will be reduced to stage 2. Eskom said they will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes that may be necessary. On Saturday evening, breakdowns occurred on a unit each at Tukuta, Camden and Majuba power stations. Generating units at Hendrina and Majuba power stations returned to service on Sunday. “We currently have 2 094MW on planned maintenance, while another 17 640 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” said Eskom in a statement. The power utility urged South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially between 5am and 9am and 4pm and 10pm.
