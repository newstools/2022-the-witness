Eskom announced load shedding would be reduced to Stage 2
from 8 am to 4 pm on Sunday, but it will revert to Stage 3 from 4 pm to 10 pm. The country has been subjected to fluctuating load shedding
stages in the past two weeks. In a statement released on Sunday morning, Eskom said since Saturday
afternoon a generating unit each at the Arnot, Hendrina, Tutuka and two at the
Lethabo Power Station were returned to service. The power utility said a generating unit each at the Duvha
and Camden power stations were taken offline for repairs. “We currently have 4 009MW on planned maintenance, while
another 14 515MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust
and communicate any changes as may be necessary. We appeal to all South
Africans to help limit the impact of loadshedding by reducing the usage of electricity
and to switch off all non-essential items,” said Eskom. South Africans were also urged to continue using electricity
sparingly especially between 5 am to 9 am in the mornings and 4 pm to 10 pm in
the evenings.
