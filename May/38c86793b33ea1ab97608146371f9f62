Two people died after two cars and a truck collided along the N11, near Papworth, 15 kilometers outside Ladysmith, on Sunday morning. The truck, which was carrying cargo, crashed nose first down the bridge. “The truck driver and his assistant are extremely lucky to have escaped from the truck,” said an official on the scene of the crash. One of the cars overturned and landed on its roof. The seven people who were travelling in it were treated for moderate injuries by paramedics from KZN EMS. Two people from the second car were declared dead at the scene. They had to be cut free from the mangled wreck with the Jaws of Life. Two others were treated for injuries on the scene before they were transported to the local hospital for further medical treatments. At the time of publication it was not clear what the cause of the crash was but Elandslaagte police were investigating a case of culpable homicide.
