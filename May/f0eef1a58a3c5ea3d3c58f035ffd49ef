Eskom announced that Stage 2 load shedding will continue for the whole week from 5 pm to 10 pm. The power utility said this is due to the continued shortage of generation capacity While there may be instances where load shedding might need to be implemented outside of these hours, Eskom said as far as possible it will endeavour to limit the implementation of load shedding to the evening peak in order to limit the impact of the capacity shortages on the public. “We currently have 3 028MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 992MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” said Eskom. The power utility said it will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. Eskom went on to urge all South Africans to help limit the impact of load shedding by reducing the usage of electricity, and to switch off all non-essential items.
