Water has been restored to Umlazi’s Prince Mshiyeni Hospital and other areas following the floods that damaged infrastructure in April. The eThekwini Municipality said the restoration follows the completion of repairs to a major pipeline near the Umlaas Canal that was severely damaged by the recent floods. Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said other neighbouring areas are also receiving water gradually as the system builds up. He said the recent floods severely damaged infrastructure, which resulted in the hospital and some parts of uMlazi struggling with water supply. “Technicians have been working tirelessly to repair the pipeline. Now that the repairs are complete the water has started to flow through the pipeline filling the system. “As the day progresses, the system will build up and start to supply the higher laying areas of uMlazi,” said Mayisela. Mayisela said water is expected to be fully restored in areas supplied by this pipeline in a day or two. He added the team will continue monitoring the system until it is fully functioning.
