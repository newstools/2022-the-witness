Loadshedding has made a comeback as Eskom announced the implementation of Stage 2 loadshedding from 5 pm this afternoon until 5 am on Monday. According to the statement released by Eskom, this bout of loadshedding has been caused by a shortage of generation capacity owing to delays in returning generators to service, as well as the breakdown of nine generators. “Since yesterday a generation unit each at Lethabo, Tutuka, Ingula, Drakensberg, Arnot as well as two units each at Hendrina and Matla power stations suffered breakdowns. “Further, delays in returning generators to service at Arnot, Kendal and three units at Tutuka power stations have added to the capacity constraints,” reads the statement. The statement also said that they expect to rely on the use of emergency reserves to limit the stage of loadshedding during this period. “We currently have 3 875MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 067MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” read the statement. Eskom has said they will continue to monitor the system and implement any changes as required and they also expect to return as many of these units to service as possible over the next few days
