Former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption trial has now been postponed to August 1, at the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The court heard on Tuesday that Zuma’s application for the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to reconsider his application to remove state prosecutor Billy Downer, is still pending. Judge Piet Koen postponed the matter to August 1, as a holding date. It is hoped that the SCA would have made a ruling by then. The judge said if the ruling has been made, then Zuma must stand trial from August 15 to September 16 and then from November 7 to December 2. Zuma is charged with fraud and corruption in relation to the arms deal.
