The Police in KwaZulu- Natal have mobilised all resources to apprehend those who shot and killed an off-duty police officer outside a school in Umbilo, Durban on Wednesday afternoon. According to the statement released by the police, 52-year-old Warrant Officer Michael Jameson was picking up his daughter from a school in Umbilo when he noticed a hijacking in progress. They said he immediately placed himself on duty and responded to the incident. “Upon noticing that the member was armed, the suspects opened fire. The member returned fire but sadly succumbed to his injuries on scene,” read the statement. The National Commissioner of the SAPS, General Fannie Masemola said that Jameson died a hero serving and protecting the people of his country by putting himself on duty and putting the safety of his community before his own. “Let me take this opportunity to pay gratitude to the deceased member. The bell has rung, thank you for your service and dedication to serve and protect. We will not rest until the late members killers are traced and apprehended to answer to this callous act,” said General Masemola. He also added that police are working around the clock to apprehend those responsible for his murder. Two vehicles including a vehicle that was hijacked outside the school in Umbilo and another that was hijacked in Hammersdale by the men thought to be responsible have been found abandoned.
