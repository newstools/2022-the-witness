KwaZulu-Natal Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka, on Wednesday warned the province’s residents about the dangers of using water from rivers in the aftermath of the recent floods. Briefing the media in Durban, Hlomuka said tests have revealed that water from rivers, streams and other natural sources is currently not safe for drinking. “The infrastructure damages owing to recent torrential rains pose a risk of the contamination of water sources such as rivers. “As restoration of water has progressed in most areas, the focus will now be on the protection of water resources to minimise deterioration. “Most water resources (rivers) in eThekwini District have been found to have a significantly high percentage of water contaminants (mainly E.Coli) due to raw sewer spillages owing to water treatment works infrastructure damages,” he said. The floods, Hlomuka said, have increased the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases such cholera, hepatitis and typhoid fever. “We are appealing to communities to exercise extreme caution when dealing with water from rivers,” Hlomuka said.
