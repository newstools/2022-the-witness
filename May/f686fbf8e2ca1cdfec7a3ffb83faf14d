A 40-year-old man was killed on Wednesday morning after he jumped from an out of control taxi that allegedly experienced brake failure on Trenance Park, Amaotana outside Durban. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), the man was found lying on the road bleeding excessively from an injury to his head. He was declared dead by Medics from a private ambulance service at the scene. Spokesperson for Rusa, Prem Balram, said the driver informed their officers that he advised the man not to jump as he attempted to bring the taxi to a stop. “It was established that the brakes on the mini bus failed when [the man] opened the sliding door and attempted to jump to safety however he struck the metal barrier with his head,” said Balram. He added the taxi conductor fled the scene following the accident.
