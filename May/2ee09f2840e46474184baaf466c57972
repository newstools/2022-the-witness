Maphalala said she has been told that he was shot three times. She said: “I want the person who did this to my son to rot in jail. Maybe that will help me get some closure,” she said. Maphalala said her son was never a violent person and was loved by everyone. He had been a street vendor at the Imbali rank since 2019 and sold cooldrinks and fruit.

She said a 51-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene and the firearm used was seized by police for further investigation. “The suspect will appear in court soon,” said Gwala.
