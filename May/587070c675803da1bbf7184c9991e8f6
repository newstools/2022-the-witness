The search is on for two eThekwini Municipal employees who are believed to have drowned on Saturday afternoon. Solomon Shandu and Simphiwe Cele were returning from a funeral in Harrismith when they went missing. Shandu last made contact with his family on Saturday when they left the funeral. The car they were driving in was spotted submerged in the Ogunjini River on Monday. They were driving home in eNtaphuka ,in the Ndwedwe area, during a storm when their vehicle was swept off a bridge. Shandu’s family reportedly contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) for assistance after the vehicle was spotted in the river on Monday. Reactions Unit’s officers searched the area on Monday but could not find them. On Tuesday morning Rusa sent out its R44 helicopter and crew to Ogunjini on a recovery operation which was joined by paramedics as well as the SAPS search and rescue personnel. While at the scene, the rescue team was apparently told that the car was actually driven by Cele. He was en route to drop of Shandu at his home when the white Toyota Etios was swept off a low-lying bridge. Shandu and Cele are employed at the eThekwini Municipality’s water department in Ottawa, Verulam. On Tuesday, municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said this was a very sensitive matter, and the municipality could not comment at this time. “The City sympathises with all the families of those still missing, and we pray that they are found,” he said.
