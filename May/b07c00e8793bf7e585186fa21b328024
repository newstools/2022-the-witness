A jilted boyfriend has been arrested for the murder of his girlfriend who he allegedly killed at her school in front of her classmates in Ndwedwe, on the North Coast. According to a statement released by The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL), it is alleged that the 21-year-old man stormed into the school premises and dragged Phindile Gcwensa (18) before stabbing her several times until she died, on Thursday last week. She had previously opened a rape case against the man who was subsequently released on bail. It is alleged he forced her to withdraw the case. ANCWL provincial secretary, Nonhlanhla Gabela, said that the man needs to be prosecuted and handed the life sentence.
