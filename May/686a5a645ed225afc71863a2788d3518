It is almost time for the local Polar bear swim, which aids animal shelters. This challenge, which has been taking place for more than 20 years now is a fun-filled family event with activities for everyone, such as the swim, the Waka Waka Market, a children’s play area, and more. According to a statement released by the organisation, this year’s festivities are set to take place at the Dragon Peaks Mountain Resort on June 25 until late and everyone has been invited. All proceeds of the event are donated to the Estcourt Animal Shelter, Khetani Animal Rescue, and Animal Angels Central Berg. People who wish to participate have been invited to request more information on berginfomedia@gmail.com The only rule of the Polar Bear Swim is that there are no wetsuits allowed, however, participants can pre-order and purchase a Polar Bear Swim Shirt. The Polar bear swim was founded by Anne Gray for Winterton Primary School. Gray started this initiative to raise awareness and to bring to the attention of as many people as possible the suffering of animals. She also wanted to help those who do their very best to save them.
