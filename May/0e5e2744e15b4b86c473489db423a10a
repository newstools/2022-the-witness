The Nquthu Regional Court sentenced a 35-year-old man to life imprisonment for ‘brutally’ raping his 11-year-old niece. KZN police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said on September 9, 2018, at Mondlo, the eleven-year-old girl was at her uncle’s home. “He forced the little girl to watch a pornographic video and raped her. She was given R8 and was threatened with death should she tell anyone.” Gwala said the girl was brave enough and decided to report the matter to her elders. A case of rape was opened at Mondlo SAPS and it was transferred to Vryheid Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences who took over the investigation. “Following a sterling investigation, the accused was placed under arrest and was tried in court. After making several court appearances, he was finally sentenced in court,” said Gwala. The man was also declared unfit to possess a firearm and his name will be put on the sexual offenders’ register.
