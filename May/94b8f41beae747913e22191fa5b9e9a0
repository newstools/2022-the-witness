Confusion over Msunduzi’s planned power outage left many residents fuming when the municipality changed the period without adequate prior notice. This happed while several other areas were said to be experiencing electricity faults on Tuesday morning. Tuesday’s planned power outage, which was announced by Msunduzi days prior, was meant to start at 8 am but the lights did not go off and there was no explanation from the city. The municipality only updated the residents about the delay through a Facebook post around 12 pm. “The planned Riverside Primary Substation commenced at 11h00 instead of 08h00 as initially communicated due to unforeseen circumstances. We will keep you posted about the progress or if there any delays on restoration. We apologize for delays,” wrote Msunduzi on Facebook. Meanwhile, communities that were not supposed to be affected by the planned outage found themselves without power on Tuesday morning, Areas affected included Cedara, Primula, Berryhill, parts of Oribi Village, Wembley, parts of Montrose, Town Hill as well as Old Howick Road and surrounding areas. The Pietermaritzburg CBD was also affected as West Street, Victoria Street, Pine Street, Winston, Clark, Greyling, Boom, Berg, Commercial, Boshoff and surrounding streets did not have electricity on Tuesday morning. Signal Hill, Mayors Walk, parts of Prestbury, Clarendon, Boughton, Blackridge, Athlone, parts of Northern Park and surrounding areas also had no power. According Msunduzi, all trips were being attended to and investigated, however no time frames had been set yet. Residents were not impressed by Msunduzi’s lack of proper communication saying that they were also not informed as to why their power was off. In the afternoon, Msunduzi municipality spokesperson, Ntobeko Mkhize, apologised for the inconvenience and delays, adding that the maintenance work had been completed and power had been restored.
