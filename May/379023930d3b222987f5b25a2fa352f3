Eskom has warned that it could implement load shedding at short notice on Monday evening. Although the power system has recovered sufficiently to meet the demand during the day, Eskom says it might be required to implement load shedding at short notice during the evening peaks should there be further breakdowns in currently available capacity. “We expect to return to service generation unit each at Kusile and Kendal power stations before the evening power. Should any of these units fail to return as expected, the power system will be severely constrained, presenting an increased probability of load shedding at short notice,” said Eskom in a statement. The power utility added that the return to service of generation units at Matimba and Lethabo, as well as two units at Hendrina and three at Tutuka power stations have been delayed which increased the evening peak constraints. “The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to a constrained system, particularly during the morning and evening peaks, throughout the winter.” Eskom urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially between 5am to 9am in the mornings and 4pm to 10pm in the evenings.
