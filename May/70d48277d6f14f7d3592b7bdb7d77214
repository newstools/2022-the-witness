The body of an unidentified man was discovered under a bridge on the banks of Tongaat River in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, Prem Balram, said the body was discovered by a passersby who contacted them for assistance. He said their officers and paramedics had to walk along the railway line until they reached the river bank. “On examination, the deceased was found to have sustained a head injury. His pockets were turned inside out. It could not be established if he had fallen or had been pushed from the bridge above as the guard rails were missing,” said Balram. He added the Tongaat SAPS were on scene and are investigating further.
