A 72-year-old man was arrested with two others after they were found in possession of illegal firearms in KwaZulu-Natal, on Friday. The police said that the first arrest came after the stabilisation team conducted an operation at the Peace Valley area, in the Plessislaer policing precinct in the early hours of the morning. KZN Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the team went to a house where an elderly man (72) was found in unlawful possession of a firearm with two rounds of ammunition. “The team proceeded to Imbali Unit 14, where a 39-year-old suspect was found in possession of a firearm. He was also placed under arrest,” said Gwala. On the third arrest, Gwala said the team was conducting patrol duties in Umlazi, south of Durban, when they received information about a man (31) who was in possession of a firearm. Gwala said the firearm was found hidden underneath a couch with seven rounds of ammunition.
