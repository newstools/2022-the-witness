Pietermaritzburg swimming sensation Matthew Sates ended the Mare Nostrum series in Europe with an impressive total of nine gold medals on Sunday. Sates (18) finished the tour with a victory in the 200m medley in the final session of the three-city series in Canet, France. The previous legs were held in Monaco and Barcelona since last weekend. A specialist in freestyle and individual medley, Sates held off America’s Samuel Stewart and Switzerland’s Jérémy Desplanches in his last race in the outdoor pool. He had a strong start and finish in clocking one minute and 57,77 seconds, while Stewart dominated the middle section and came home in 1:59,15, followed by Desplanches in 1:59,28. As was the case in the Fina World Cup series in Europe and Asia last October, Sates proved to be the most successful of the South African competitors in the Mare Nostrum. He grabbed four golds in Monaco, three in Barcelona and two in Canet. Each venue hosted two days of competition, and each victory was rewarded, plus bonuses were offered for meet records and other feats.

Gauteng’s Pieter Coetze (18) was the next best performer in the youthful South African group, with four golds, while a smaller number of medals went the way of Lara van Niekerk (19) and veteran Chad le Clos. Coetze came third in his last race in the men’s 100m backstroke on Sunday in 53.84, after Ryosuke Irie of Japan (53.00) and Yohann Ndoye-Brouard of France (53.15). Pretoria’s Van Niekerk (30.25) came second to American Lydia Jacoby (30.20) in her last challenge in the women’s 50m breaststroke yesterday. The next major competition is the World Championships in Hungary from the middle of next month, followed by the Commonwealth Games in England from the end of July.
