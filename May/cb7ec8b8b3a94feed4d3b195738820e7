A man in his 50s was stabbed to death during a robbery at his home in Verulam outside Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday morning. Spokesperson of the Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) Prem Balram said it was believed the man was stabbed by the robbers as they were making their getaway. “Members of RUSA were at the scene at 3.14am after a resident located the unresponsive man in a pathway. His neighbour informed reaction officers that he was accosted by four suspects who forced their way into his residence. They were armed with firearms and knives. They stole his TV, cell phone and other household items before they left,” said Balram. He said medics examined the man and discovered he had died after he was stabbed once in the back. KwaZulu-Natal police were yet to comment.
