eThekwini Municipality's emergency personnel are on standby, after the South African Weather Service (Saws) on Sunday issued a stern warning on the probability of damaging gale force winds along the coast of KZN on Monday morning. The city of Durban has been cited as one of the areas along the coast that are likely to bear the brunt of these winds. Waves of between 4m to 6m between midnight on Sunday and 12pm on Monday, are expected. This is likely to trigger rough seas to the detriment of freight and recreational fishing vessels, Saws said. eThekwini urged the public, more especially residents in informal settlements, to be cautious when using fires during this period, as there is a likelihood of it getting fanned quickly, a recipe for a calamity.
