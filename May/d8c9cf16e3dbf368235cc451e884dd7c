A mother of a four-year-old who survived after she was kidnapped, strangled and thrown into the Duzi River says her child is still traumatised and has nightmares every night. The mother, whose name is known to The Witness, was speaking to The Witness outside the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court, on Thursday on the sidelines of Nontuthuko Manqele’s (21) bail application. Manqele was arrested on May 17 for attempted murder and kidnapping charges. It is alleged that Manqele kidnapped, repeatedly strangled and threw the child into the river next to Alexandra Park, in Pietermaritzburg. She was arrested that afternoon. During the bail application on Thursday, the matter was postponed to June 2, after the court heard that the investigating officer had not been able to confirm Manqele’s residential address. A large group of community members picketed outside the court building calling for the denial Manqele’s bail application. Speaking to The Witness, the mother said the incident has left her with psychological scars and fear. She said it shocked, not only her family, but also the community of Pietermaritzburg as well. She said she could tell that her daughter had not fully recovered from what happened to her. “Any mother would be heartbroken every day. She is my only child and to think that she could have died on her birthday, is something that I cannot get out of my mind. “She can’t sleep. She wakes up every night and screams. She is not okay and sometimes she would just randomly cry. When I ask her what is wrong, she doesn’t say,” she said.
