The sardines are making their way up from the Eastern Cape towards KwaZulu-Natal. This was confirmed by the KZN Sharks Board which conducted yet another observation flight into the Eastern Cape waters to assess the movement of the sardine shoals on Tuesday. The flight departed from Durban Virginia Airport and turned at Hole in the Wall. According to Sharks Board’s head of operations, Greg Thompson, the water was very discoloured for most of the coastline, especially in KZN due to the latest flooding. However, the visibility improved as they got into the Eastern Cape and from the Msikaba area the activity started to pick up. “The most favourable water visibility on this flight was only approximately 3-4m and this was in the entire area between Hole in the Wall and Umgazana. “These indications are all positive, that the sardines are making their way up from the Eastern Cape towards KwaZulu-Natal. Especially, when you take the increase in shark activity at Grosvenor into consideration. There is also a good possibility that we may have missed activity further north towards KZN due to the poor visibility,” said Thompson. However, he added, there have been many occasions in the past when predictions and opinions have been totally incorrect. “These fish can move through in the deep or in the discoloured water that we are experiencing at the moment, out of sight of most of the predators and arrive in KZN without warning. Then there is always the possibility that they continue moving north on the deeper line and we don’t get to see them at all,” Thompson said. The next flight to East London is scheduled for the June 2, however, this is dependent on weather conditions.
