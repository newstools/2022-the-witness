Superb Jumbo-Visma teamwork from the breakaway gave Dutch rider Koen Bouwman his first Grand Tour stage win in the Giro d’Italia on Friday. Bouwman survived an attritional climbing day in the break with teammate Tom Dumoulin. The pair approached the finish along with Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) and Davide Formolo (UAE Team Emirates). A clearly fatigued Dumoulin sacrificed his chances to lead the group into the final kilometre, where a stinging ramp to the line with 600 metres to go welcomed them. Bouwman was the first to launch his sprint with Mollema following, but there was little he or Formolo could do to stop the Dutchman from holding the gap he’d made and reach the line to claim the 196km-stage 7 win. Juan Pedro López (Trek-Segafredo) retained the pink jersey.
