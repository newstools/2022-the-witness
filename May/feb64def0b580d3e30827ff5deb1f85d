A Pretoria man, SD Heijns, is said to have set a new world record for skipping rope at Sun International’s Maslow Time Square Hotel in Pretoria. Heijns (21) completed 71 185 skips in eight hours surpassing the previous record of 70 031 by 1 154 skips. Heijns said he started skipping when he was 12 years old as part of his kickboxing training and now skips for up to eight hours a week. “The longest I had skipped prior to this attempt was six hours, and this was the hardest part of today’s record attempt. My best hour was my last hour when I did more skips than the first hour,” said Heijns. He averaged around 9 000 skips per hour. According to a statement released by Times Square, a pressure plate system mat counted the number of skips. There was also a system to ensure that the skipping rope made a complete revolution, and two skipping ropes were used during the attempt. Heijns added that skipping formed an integral part of his personal training regime to stay fit during the Covid-19 lockdown and this is when he started toying with the idea of breaking the Guinness World Record. The previous Guinness World Record was held by Sella Rosa Rega from Boiceville, New York, in the United States. Heijns said that he also intends to break 12- and 24-hour records in the future. The record attempt was registered with the Guinness World Record body and monitored by the Sports Science Lab for verification purposes. Guinness must still declare it an official record.
