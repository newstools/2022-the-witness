The South African Petroleum Industry Association has injected 20 million litres of jet fuel into the multi-product pipeline in Durban. A statement by the Jet Fuel Forum Committee said the fuel is expected to get to O.R Tambo International Airport on May 27. It said this was in addition to the weekly 16 million litres transported directly from the National Petroleum Refiners of South Africa to O.R Tambo via the dedicated Transnet Jet Fuel Pipeline. They said despite disruptions to the transportation of jet fuel as a result of the recent KwaZulu-Natal floods, exacerbated by the railway infrastructure damage resulting in a force majeure being declared by multiple fuel suppliers, only two flights have cancelled since the jet fuel challenge started. Between May 9 and 16, O.R Tambo had a total of 1 726 flight movements, with 708 being international flights and 1 018 domestic flights. They had no cancellations of flights. The committee said the Transnet Freight Rail infrastructure rehabilitation was on track and the next milestone was the resumption of a single line operation on the container corridor mainline from June followed by a double line operation commencing from September. “As imports become available for transportation via rail or pipelines, Transnet, through the relevant operating division’s will ensure that this jet fuel is transported to O.R Tambo International Airport,” said the statement.
