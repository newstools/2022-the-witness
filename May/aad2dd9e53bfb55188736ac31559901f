Motorists can still expect a traffic backlog on the N3 towards Durban, after the Key Ridge interchange, in KwaZulu-Natal. The traffic, from Peacevale to the Hammarsdale interchange, is due to a sinkhole that formed as a result of the recent devastating KZN floods. RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mali told The Witness that traffic was still being diverted to one lane to avoid the sinkhole. “There are protocols that need to be taken in order to select the right contractor to fix the sinkhole properly. The public will be notified when the sinkhole is fixed,” said Mali on Monday. She continued to urge drivers to approach the area with caution. The sinkhole formed as a result of April’s torrential rains which caused the soil to erode from underneath the ground surface.
