Two trucks, a bakkie, two minibus taxis and five other cars were involved in a massive collision on the N3  south bound between the Peter Brown and Chatterton offramps in Pietermaritzburg in the early hours of  Saturday morning. It is believed that at least 11 people were confirmed dead by 7 am. According to Netcare 911, the collision resulted in a fully laden taxi bursting into flames. Netcare 911 spokesperson, Shawn Herbst, said when emergency services arrived at the scene, the fire had spread to other vehicles and had engulfed the taxi with all its occupants. “While on scene, another secondary collision occurred on the northbound carriageway which left emergency services scrambling. Multiple motorists  were injured and treated at the scene,” said Herbst. Although the official number of deaths had not been confirmed, emergency services said those who were in a taxi could not be saved. *This is a developing story.
