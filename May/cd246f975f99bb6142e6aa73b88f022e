MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal, Kwazi Mshengu, thanked pupils and community members from Dumisani Makhaye High School in Durban for standing up against ‘hooligans’ who were stealing the school’s electric cables. Mshengu said the group also ensured that the thugs were apprehended by the police. “Even though it is regrettable that there was disruption in teaching and learning as a result of the altercation with the intruders, we have always encouraged that communities must be the first defence of schools against criminals, hence we commend these learners for standing up to protect the school,” said Mshengu. He said the department has on many occasions asked communities to protect schools against vandalism and thuggery and has on various occasions also asked communities to desist from closing or disrupting teaching and learning if they have grievances or any issue with schools. Mshengu said Dumisani Makhaye High School is a state-of-the-art school recently built by the department for the Wilbadatch community, and protecting the school from thugs, should remain the priority for the community of Wilbadatch and all communities elsewhere in the province. “The department also asks for restraint from police where learners are involved, as it is reported that there were injuries during the stand-off with the police,” said Mshengu.
