Members of the KZN Inland Cricket Union in Pietermaritzburg say they are praying for one of their players who is in critical condition in an English hospital following an assault. Mondli Khumalo (21), a bowler, was reportedly assaulted in the early hours of Sunday in Bristol and taken to Southmead Hospital in the town with serious head injuries. A 27-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, British media said. KZN Inland chief executive Jason Sathiaseelan said Durban-born Khumalo has been featuring for the North Petherton Cricket Club in Bristol as an overseas professional during the ongoing recess of the South African season. He said: Khumalo was part of the senior KZN Inland team, known as Tuskers, that won the CSA One-Day Cup in April. He also represented the South African Under-19 team in the past. Sathiaseelan said they have been told that the incident happened after a night out following a match on Saturday in Bristol. “We understand that Mondli went out with some players or friends after the match. After that, he went to a taxi rank and that’s where the incident happened. We know there was a group [of] people at the scene, but only one of them was arrested. We don’t know more than that,” he said. Sathiaseelan also said he has been busy trying to make arrangements for the Durban-based family of the player to go and be with him in Bristol.
