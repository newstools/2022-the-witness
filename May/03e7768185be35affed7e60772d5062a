An eThekwini Municipality employee along with two service providers were arrested on charges of corruption and money laundering. In a statement released on Thursday, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, said the trio were charged but currently out on bail. They face charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering, contravention of various sections of the Municipal Finance Management Act and contravention of the Competition Act. Mayisela said the employee worked as a clerk in the city’s water and sanitation unit. He said the clerk allegedly colluded with the service providers to deviate from normal supply chain management policies for personal financial gain. Mxolisi Kaunda, eThekwini Municipality mayor, commended the City’s Integrity and Investigations Unit (CIIU) and police for uncovering the corruption. “This illicit behaviour deprives our residents of access to basic services. I am on record as saying that every cent of public money must go towards improving the wellbeing of our residents. It must not go to anyone’s pocket. I am appealing to anyone suspecting any criminal activity related to the city, to report to our CIIU. Let us now allow our institutions entrusted with dispensing justice to do their work,” said Kaunda.
