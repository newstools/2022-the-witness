One person died and another was injured in a truck accident on the N3 near the Peter Brown off-ramp, Pietermaritzburg, on Friday afternoon. Roland Robertson of the Midlands EMS said the northbound lane was completely closed with only one lane open on the southbound. “We were attending another accident on the southbound when this one happened. Traffic was already moving slow and the truck driver who was driving down the hill went to the northbound side where his truck overturned,” said Robertson. According to paramedics who were at the scene, it has not been confirmed if the person who died was inside the truck or on the road when the accident happened.
