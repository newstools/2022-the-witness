The eThekwini health unit has collaborated with Scientology Volunteer Ministers to assist flood victims with counselling. According to a statement released by Scientology Volunteer Ministers, the health unit requested assistance from them to provide supportive trauma counselling to survivors of the floods as well as life skills development for communities after seeing the results of their work in Molweni where they counselled the survivors of the floods. “The national NPO travelled from their headquarters in Gauteng to provide immediate relief after the devastating floods. “Upon arriving in KZN, they set-up teams to assist in search and rescue operations, donated food parcels, blankets, organised major clean-ups and provided psycho social spiritual counselling,” read the statement. Mandy Pelser, a representative of the NPO said it was an honour to be working with the department to bring this relief on a large scale. “The floods have caused emotional and mental trauma to a lot of people, and I think that this partnership is going to benefit the community greatly,” said Pelser. The deputy director for social health for eThekwini Municipality, Gugulethu Bhengu, said that they intend to formalise this partnership and work together going forward. The volunteer ministers will also be delivering their tools for life skills development to the community at no cost and have affirmed that they will continue to work with the community for as long as needed. They are said to have already trained dozens of community members who have since made a huge change in their communities.
