Three Durban men, including a neighbour, were arrested for murdering an elderly man, Ken Price (73) and dumping his body in Richards Bay in November. The three men from Malvern aged between 22 and 31 were arrested on May 12. It is alleged that on December 6, Price was reported missing at Malvern police station by his family who couldn’t get hold of him. He had been living by himself at his home in Oliver Leese Road in Malvern. KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said it was reported that he was last seen on November 17. Gwala said the Malvern detectives went to his home and noticed blood stains but Price was nowhere to be seen. She said they also realised that some of Price’s belongings including two bikes, DVD player, tools and other items had been stolen. “On May 12, 2022, police received information that a neighbour was advertising motorbikes belonging to Price for sale.” She said police went to this man’s house, searched the premises and found items belonging to Price. He led the police to Savanah Park and Chatsworth where two other suspects were arrested. They were also found with belongings of Price’s and claimed they did not know where he was, said Gwala, who added that the three men were arrested and charged for possession of stolen property. Gwala said the trio appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Monday and were remanded in custody. Gwala said the investigation by Malvern detectives led to the recovery of Price’s body in Richards Bay mortuary on Thursday. Gwala said it is alleged that Price was attacked at home by the three men who assaulted him with a hammer on the body and head. “They covered his body with plastic and drove to Richards Bay where they dumped him in the dense bush. The decomposed body was recovered on December 7 at the Maguzulu area in Empangeni,” she said.
