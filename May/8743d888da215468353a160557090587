The Durban University of Technology (DUT) was forced to suspend on-campus activities on all its five Durban campuses due to water supply issues on Monday. Large parts of Durban were affected by widespread water supply shortages since the weekend with Umgeni Water confirming that there was an issue at their Wiggins Water Works and the Durban Heights Water Treatment Plant. “Due to health and safety concerns related to the lack of adequate water supply to our five campuses in Durban, DUT has decided to immediately suspend all on-campus operations at the Brickfield Campus, City Campus, ML Sultan Campus, Ritson Campus and the Steve Biko Campus,” said DUT on Monday. All DUT staff from these five campuses had to work remotely for the rest of the day while students were urged to continue with their academic activities online. “We reiterate that the academic programme is not suspended,” said DUT. The university said it would give an update on the water supply situation and plans for Tuesday on Monday evening. While the university was able to implement an emergency plan to provide water to DUT-owned student residences, the university said this intervention was not feasible for the rest of the affected campuses. At the time of publication DUT said it had not received any definitive date for the resumption of the municipal water supply.
