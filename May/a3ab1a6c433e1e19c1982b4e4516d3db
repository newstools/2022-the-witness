Two men suspected to have hijacked a minibus taxi were arrested following a shoot-out with police in Mooi River, in KwaZulu-Natal. Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said on Sunday just before 11.30 am, police officers from the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit were following up on information about a minibus taxi that was hijacked at Meyi location, in Ibisi, and while en route to Mooi River on the N3. “Police officers attempted to intercept the taxi, but the suspects sped off whilst shooting at police officers. The suspects drove through the boom gate at the Mooi Toll Plaza and sped off,” said Gwala. She said at Riversdale, in Mooi River, three men alighted from their vehicle and continued shooting at police officers. “The suspect’s vehicle crashed into a wall of a home, and police arrested two suspects aged 22 and 23. One of the suspects sustained a gunshot wound to the thigh,” she said. Inside the taxi, Gwala said police found a pistol with two rounds of ammunition and a gas gun. She said it was confirmed that the minibus taxi was hijacked in the Ibisi policing area. One of the men appeared in court on Monday and the other was expected to appear before the Mooi River Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. They were charged with attempted murder, possession of a stolen vehicle as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.
