Knorr has recalled their Cup-a-soup beef and vegetable lite products. According to a statement released by the company, they discovered that a small number of Knorr “Cup-a-Soup Beef and Vegetable Lite” boxes which they produced, mistakenly contain sachets of Knorr “Cup-a-Soup Beef and Vegetable Regular”, meaning that the affected stock does not declare the presence of wheat and gluten as allergens on the box. “If you have any boxes of Knorr “Cup-a-Soup Beef and Vegetable Lite” marked with BB 22SEPT 23 2082 E please do not use them but rather return the products to your nearest retailer for a refund,” read the statement. Customers have been urged to return the products and not to dispose of it themselves. “If you are allergic to wheat / gluten and have experienced any symptoms after using a sachet of Knorr “Cup-a-Soup Beef and Vegetable Lite” from the affected batch, please contact your doctor and inform the Unilever SA Consumer Careline on 0860 331 441,” read the statement. The group has said that no other products are affected by this recall.
