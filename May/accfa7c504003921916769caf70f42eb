SANRAL has warned motorists to expect traffic delays on the N3 southbound, due to a sinkhole that has formed after the Key Ridge Interchange. According to SANRAL’s eastern region operations and maintenance manager, Dudley Mbambo, the sinkhole is causing major traffic congestion from Peacevale to the Hammarsdale interchange. “Motorists are advised to approach Key Ridge Interchange cautiously and plan their trips accordingly. Our engineers are on scene to assess the situation and start with repair works,” said Mbambo. RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mali also confirmed the sinkhole and added that cars are being diverted onto another lane to avoid traffic congestion. The sinkhole formed as a result of the torrential rains the province has seen in April which caused the soil to erode from underneath.
