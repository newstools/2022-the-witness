The Durban University of Technology has warned of a scammer who is falsely inviting people to a fictitious alumni event. According to the senior director of corporate affairs at DUT, Alan Khan, the university was alerted of a scam that is currently circulating via email and WhatsApp of an event that claims to be taking place on Friday, May 27. “We urge those who have received any form of communication from this individual or any other sender using a fake account, that claims to be from DUT, to please delete the message and not share their personal information, in the hope of receiving any financial remuneration, free flights and accommodation, or any other promise that the fraudster is using to trap innocent people,” said Khan. He also said that the con artist uses the name of Clement Mogale and claims to be an events coordinator at the university. “DUT wants to place it on record that there is no Mr Clement Mogale working within the marketing, PR and events department or in the advancement and alumni relations department at the university,” said Khan. Khan also added that all official DUT emails originate from @dut.ac.za accounts and not from @alumni.com or any other domains.
