Pupils may not remove their face masks at school after all. The Department of Health did a U-turn on Thursday on a statement issued on Wednesday about the removal of face masks by children at school. The department said they received “a lot of feedback from the public since announcing the extension of public consultation processes, together with the introduction of limited health regulations meant to manage the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and future notifiable medical conditions”. The department said: “Therefore, children like other people, are expected to continue complying with the provisions of regulation 16A on face masks in the classrooms and general indoor gatherings, unlike outdoors in playgrounds and sports fields,” said the statement. It said that face masks are an effective intervention against the spread of Covid-19, “and it is more relevant now, as the number of Covid-19 positive cases is rising once again”. Lastly, the department reminded the public that vaccination services against Covid-19 remain available and accessible, saying “we can mitigate the impact of the anticipated fifth wave and emerging variants”.
