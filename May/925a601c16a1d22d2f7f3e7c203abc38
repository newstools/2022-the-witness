The KwaZulu-Natal Heath Department says it is on high alert for the monkeypox. Department MEC Nomagugu Simelane has allayed fears on monkeypox and assured the public that the province is on high alert, and doing everything possible to screen people and cargo coming in from countries where the disease has been confirmed. Simelane said the province’s communicable disease surveillance and control systems have been activated, and that they were ready for any eventuality. She was speaking on the sidelines of the department’s Post-Budget Stakeholder Engagement programme which was held at the Moses Mabhida Stadium early on Thursday. She said the province’s healthcare facilities have enough isolation and quarantine beds that can accommodate patients in the event that monkeypox hits the province. She further reiterated the national communique issued by the National Health Director-General Dr Sandile Buthelezi this week, which stated that there have been no laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox in the country and on the continent.
