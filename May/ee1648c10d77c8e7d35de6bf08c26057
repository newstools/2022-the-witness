The Association for the Aged (Tafta) has invited the public to support its annual elder abuse awareness campaign as a build-up to World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15. According to a statement released by Tafta, they will embark on an awareness programme that includes reaching out to local communities in public spaces, and schools, to educate on and promote the reporting of elder abuse. Lauren Klingbiel, of Clifton School in Durban, is heading the awareness programme with pupils at Clifton and has already managed to raise R5000 towards Tafta’s needy pensioners programme by completing chores in their neighbourhoods, and by adopting the purple hearts sticker programme which encourages supporters to purchase Tafta branded stickers to encourage solidarity in standing up against elder abuse. “Our goal is to raise a minimum of R10 000 to assist Tafta in their efforts of ensuring elders’ rights are upheld. We will also host 50 of their elders at our school for a morning of tea and entertainment performed by our pupils to show our support and enrich the lives of those who once cared for us,” said Klingbiel. Tafta also added that the next phase in the campaign will see the organisation reaching out to communities by hosting mall activations in various suburbs where local shoppers will have the opportunity to learn more about Tafta, impact an elder’s life through a monetary donation, and win prizes through interactive stands. “Proceeds raised through these activations will go toward Tafta’s needy pensioners fund, from which money is accessed to facilitate rehabilitation, support and independence for elders who have been victim to elder abuse,” read the statement. Tafta CEO, Femada Shamam, said that the organisation will also be sharing information and resources on how to reach out, access support and report suspected elder abuse on social media. “In providing support for elders in need of assistance, we will simultaneously promote Tafta’s meals on wheels programme which is used by our social workers when addressing elder abuse cases as a means to ensure elders’ basic rights to food and nutrition are met,” said Shamam.
