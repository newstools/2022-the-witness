The 58th Art in the Park closed on a high note on Monday with its organisers saying it was a great success. The five-day art exhibition that could not take place in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 lockdown recorded unprecedented numbers of visitors this year. “We have made great strides since a 2015 independent survey to improve the racial and age mix of the show and this year we achieved this at greater levels, “While consumers’ disposable income has shrunk, most exhibitors recorded good sales,” said Dumisani Mhlongo, director of Pietermaritzburg Tourism. One of the exhibitors, Neville Pickford, said it was a great recovery from Covid-19 lockdown, but a few things can be improved for the exhibition’s 60th anniversary celebrations.
