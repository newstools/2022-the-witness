The South African Weather services (SAWS) has issued a yellow (level two) warning for the north-eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. On Monday SAWS said scattered to widespread showers and thundershowers are expected over north-eastern parts of KZN, as the cut-off low exits the country. “Models are still indicating significant amount of rainfall in the north-eastern parts of KZN that could result in localised flooding and minor impacts,” read SAWS' statement. Meanwhile weather forecaster, Wiseman Dlamini, said that the weather is expected to improve significantly in other parts of KZN today. “A cold front is expected to move through on Wednesday night leading to isolated showers along the coast on Thursday,” said Dlamini. Dlamini added that fine weather is expected from Friday afternoon until Sunday.
