Two Pietermaritzburg men were sentenced to 18 months for breaking through the perimeter fence of the Retief Street Primary Substation. The pair, Xolani Mbeje and Mzwandile Mnyaka were found guilty of damage to municipal infrastructure and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment each. According to Lucas Holtzhausen of Msunduzi’s Safe City, Mbeje and Mnyaka were arrested after they were detected by a Safe City operator breaking through the perimeter fence of the substation. He said the incident took place on February 18, before 1 am. Holtzhausen said the police from Pietermaritzburg police station were notified and dispatched to the substation where they arrested the two men on the scene. He said the pair admitted that they wanted to steal electrical cables. Holtzhausen welcomed the sentencing and said in the past, Msunduzi Municipality was plagued with continuous power outages where primary substations would be vandalised for copper and other critical electrical gear. “These outages had a crippling effect on the business and manufacturing sectors, especially in the Mkondeni and Willowton Road areas,” he said. Holtzhausen added: Holtzhausen said during the 2016/17 financial year, an amount of R6,5 million was allocated to Safe City and 98 CCTV cameras were installed at eight primary electrical substations. He said a dedicated surveillance desk was assigned to monitor these substations on a 24/7 basis. “Since the installation of the CCTV cameras at these primary substations, no power outages were caused by theft or vandalism,” added Holtzhausen.
