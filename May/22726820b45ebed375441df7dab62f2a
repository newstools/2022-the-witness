Supreme Court of Appeal’s (SCA) president, Mandisa Maya, has
dismissed former president Jacob Zuma’s application for the review of an order
dismissing his bid to have the lead prosecutor in his corruption case removed. In March SCA judges dismissed Zuma’s application to set
aside a Pietermaritzburg High Court ruling turning down his request for the
removal of the lead prosecutor, Billy Downer, from his arms deal corruption
case. Zuma then lodged an application for Maya to reconsider the
SCA judges’ order. According to a media statement issued by the office of the
Chief Justice on Thursday evening, Maya dismissed Zuma’s application on May 20. While there have been delays in dealing with Zuma’s
application to Maya, the office of the chief justice said the delays were not
of the SCA president’s making. “It is most unfortunate that the delays on these two matters
have been directly attributed to the President of the SCA, Justice Maya. “Some reports have suggested that the delays were a
deliberate act on her part,” the office of the Chief Justice said. The delays were due to administrative processes within the
office of the Chief Justice. Justice Maya’s dismissal of Zuma’s application meant that
his arms deal corruption trial will resume in the Pietermaritzburg High Court
on August 15. However, the start of Zuma’s trial could be further delayed
should he opt to challenge Maya’s ruling in the Constitutional Court.
