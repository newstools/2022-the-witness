A man allegedly shot three people after an altercation in the Gezubuso area outside Pietermaritzburg and later shot himself on Friday afternoon. It is alleged the man who was out drinking saw three people who had assaulted him years back. They apparently had an argument before he shot them and ran away from the scene. Roland Robertson of the Midlands EMS said when they arrived at the scene, the three were already dead and they found the man who allegedly shot them at a distance from the scene. He had shot himself and paramedics found him in a critical condition. "He was rushed to the hospital but unfortunately, he also died on his arrival," said Robertson. Attempts to get comments from the police were unsuccessful.
