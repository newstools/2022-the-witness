A 50-year-old man is fighting for his life after being shot in the head during an alleged hijacking in Isipingo, south-west of Durban. Kyle van Reenen, Emer-G-Paramedics spokesperson, said they arrived on scene at 7am on Thursday morning to find the man in critical condition. “Several advanced life support interventions were needed to stabilise him before he was placed onto a mechanical ventilator to assist him in breathing,” he said. Van Reenen said the man had to be airlifted to a specialist facility for further care. Police were on scene and would be conducting further investigations. BOLO (Be On The Lookout) reports have been circling on social media for a white Toyota Hilux GD6 that the man was driving.
