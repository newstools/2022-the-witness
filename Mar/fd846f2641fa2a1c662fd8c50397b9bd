This means improved availability of water for residents,” he said. As the country is gearing up for National Water Week, the municipality said residents are reminded that South Africa has become water scarce. As such, water resources are under pressure with a growing demand for water supply. To ensure water security for all, a collaborative approach is required from various stakeholders to respond to water challenges and advance water solutions, they said. Kaunda appealed to the public to work with the City to respond to water challenges. He said: “This will reduce constant interruption of water supply and ensure water security for all residents,” he added.
