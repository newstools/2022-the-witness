A five-year-old boy was found dead with his eyes gouged out in Mahlongwa on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast on Monday. According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, the boy was reported missing to the Umkomaas Police Station after he did not return from playing with his friends on Sunday. The next day, Gwala added, the five-year-old’s body was found by boys who were hunting with their dogs in the bushes. “The victim had a deep open wound on the head and his eyes were gouged out. A case of murder was opened for investigation,” said Gwala. Ward 18 councillor, Nokulunga Nzama, said the news of the boy’s death was disturbing. Nzama added that they are calling on the police to catch the people behind the murder so that all residents can get closure and feel safe again in the area. Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Social Development spokesperson, Mhlabunzima Memela, told The Witness that it is shocking to know that a person can kill an innocent child. Memela said a team of social workers will be dispatched to the family to provide support. He added that they call on law enforcement agencies to do a thorough investigation to ensure that the suspect gets exposed for the horrific crime. “We also call on parents to ensure that they always preserve the rights of children and protect them at all times. The parents must ensure that children always play near them,” said Memela.
