More than half of the 15,000-entry cap for the 2022 Comrades Marathon has been claimed in the first day of the entry process. Entries for the 95th Comrades Marathon which will be held in August this year opened on Wednesday and saw thousands of eager athletes running at the chance to participate by entering, after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19. Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) Race Director, Rowyn James, said that the start of this years’ entry process is one for the books. “With a new online entry system, we had a busy but amazing day of opening the entry process and getting athletes entered for the 2022 Comrades Marathon,” said James. He added that 4368 entries were successfully received within the first hour of the first entry window period. According to a statement released by the association, the entry fee for South African athletes has been discounted from R1200 to R1000 in the first entry window period, as per the CMA’s commitment when the 2020 race was cancelled. Meanwhile, the rest of Africa and international entrants in the 2020 Comrades Marathon had their entries deferred to either the 2022 or 2023 race; and do not pay an entry fee. James has urged all applicants to apply via the official Comrades Marathon website on www.comrades.com as no hand delivered or posted entries will be accepted. The highly anticipated 95th Comrades Marathon will be the 47th Down Run on Sunday, August 28, starting at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall at 5.30am and ending 12 hours later at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, covering a 90,2km distance.
