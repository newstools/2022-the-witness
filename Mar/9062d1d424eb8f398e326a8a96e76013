Pietermaritzburg residents, businesses, schools, government and municipal offices in the CBD are facing water outages following ongoing pipe bursts. Msunduzi Municipality said the City experienced a water pipe burst on the corner of Greyling and Chief Albert Luthuli streets on Friday. City spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize said the burst pipe resulted in a water outage that affected parts of the CBD. This included most of the municipality’s buildings and resulted in the disruption of operations for a number of businesses, schools, government and municipal offices. She said the water and sanitation unit undertook repairs on the burst pipe and water was restored on Friday afternoon. However, said Mkhize, the burst recurred over the weekend and that led to another burst on Peter Kerchoff Street which affected the lower CBD and also impacted on traffic. “While undertaking the repairs, a rezoning had to be made in the CBD and the water pressure was increased in an effort to ensure that businesses can still operate. Unfortunately that did not work in our favour as we then experienced a burst pipe on the corner of Victoria and Boshoff streets,” she said. She said the municipality allocated most of its resources towards the repairs of these burst pipes. Mkhize said assistance was also sought from Umgeni Water in an effort to minimise further disruption of businesses in terms of water supply. “The municipality confirms that all these burst water pipes have been resolved; we started recharging the CBD in a slow manner in order to avoid recurrences.” Mkhize added that they expect to have full water supply in the CBD on Monday.
