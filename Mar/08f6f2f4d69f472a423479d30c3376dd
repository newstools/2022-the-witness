A grade 10 and a grade 12 pupil from Hoërskool Birchleigh in Gauteng have drowned during a school trip to the beach in Durban on Sunday. Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi has expressed his deepest condolences to the families and pupils of the school. “It’s disheartening that a positive sporting school trip that our learners passionately participated in ended in such a tragic manner. We convey our most heartfelt condolences to the two affected families and the school community at large,” said Lesufi. According to a statement released by the Gauteng Education department, the school was in Durban from Thursday, where pupils were participating in a rugby tournament and were scheduled to return on Thursday. However, on Sunday, the pupils and several teachers went swimming at Durban North beach, where some pupils were reportedly helped to shore by lifeguards after experiencing challenges. After a headcount, it was realised that two pupils were missing. “All learners were accompanied back to the accommodation while the teachers proceeded to search the vicinity looking for the two missing learners. The search went on until the evening with no success, after which the educators opened a missing persons case at Durban Central Police Station,” read the statement. The following day, the teachers were told that the bodies of two boys were discovered about 2 kilometres north of the beach from where they went swimming on Sunday. “Police are investigating circumstances surrounding the incident. The pupils who died are from Birchleigh and Tembisa," read the statement. Lesufi has said that a Psycho-Social unit has been dispatched to counsel the school community of Hoërskool Birchleigh, and that this counselling will continue upon return of the learners from Durban.
