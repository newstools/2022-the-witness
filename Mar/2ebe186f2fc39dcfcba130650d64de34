The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has urged consumers in possession of certain McCain sliced beans and Spar stir fry products to return them to the point of purchase. According to the statement released by the NCC, the supplier has said that small fragments of glass were found in the products. “We urge consumer who might have these products not to consume but to return back to the retailer for a full refund or an exchange” said acting commissioner at the NCC, Thezi Mabuza. The statement also said that the products in question were manufactured from July 2021. Consumers have been urged to look for certain product descriptions to determine whether the products form part of the recall. “The safety and protection of South African consumers is the mainstay of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). “While the Commission welcomes a precautionary recall by manufactures and suppliers, we want to reiterate that regular quality check routines and processes are vitally important in order to deliver goods or services that will satisfy customers’ needs,” Mabuza said. The Commission will be monitoring the recall based on its Recall Guidelines and also allowing the supplier to conduct further investigations to detect any further potential risk.
