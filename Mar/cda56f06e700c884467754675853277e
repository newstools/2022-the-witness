Newcastle deputy mayor Musa ‘Sugar’ Thwala survived an assassination attempt on Monday evening. Thwala had just arrived at his home at around 7pm when unknown men opened fire at him. He was not hit, but one of his bodyguards was killed during the attack while the other one was hit in the arm. Thwala is the founder and leader of Team Sugar SA, which has assisted the DA in wrestling the municipality away from the ANC. Thwala is also the chairperson of the technical services portfolio committee at the municipality. DA constituency head Dr Imran Keeka said it was shocking that people are still “marked for death” because of their political affiliation. “This attack was politically motivated. It would seem that political killings have re-emerged in the province. We have had a Moerane Commission looking into political killings in the province, yet the provincial government has not implemented the recommendations of the commission. We have two of our own councillors who have received death threats recently and the matter was reported to the authorities,” said Keeka. He said a threat analysis into the two councillors was underway. “The new governance structure in Newcastle has caused a lot of upset here because there are contracts (tenders) that had to be put on hold after it was found that the supply chain management regulations were not followed. That in itself has put people's lives at risk,” he said. It is understood that the police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting. *This is a developing story.
