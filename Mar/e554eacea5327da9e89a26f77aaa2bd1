The council meeting to deliberate on the motion of no confidence against the mayor of the Okhahlamba Municipality, in Bergville, KwaZulu-Natal, descended into chaos on Wednesday morning. The motion of no confidence was brought against the Mayor Vikizithatha Mlotshwa after the DA and IFP councillors accused him of corruption. The leader of the newly formed African People's Movement (Apemo), Mlotshwa, was apparently being backed by the ANC. On Wednesday morning, Mlotshwa and the councillors supporting him stormed out of the meeting after tensions flared up. Shortly before the councillors left the chamber, Mlotshwa could be seen wrestling with an EFF councillor over a microphone.
