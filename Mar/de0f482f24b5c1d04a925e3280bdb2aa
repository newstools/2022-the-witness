The average cost of the household food basket in the KwaZulu-Natal region has shown a rapid increase over the past year. This is according to the March 2022 Household Affordability Index and key data released by the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity Group (PMBEJD) on Wednesday. “The surge in the brent crude oil price (which is an input in everything from the farm to the plate), including the higher costs of wheat, sunflower oil and other foods and agricultural inputs which South Africa imports, will drive prices upwards as the conflict in the Ukraine continues,” said Mervyn Abrahams, the PMBEJD programme coordinator. According to the group’s findings, the average cost of the household food basket increased by 10,2% from R4 039,56 in March 2021 to R4 450,09 in March 2022. The Pietermaritzburg food basket increased by R51,95 (1,2%) from February and R396,62 (10,3%) year-on-year while the Durban basket increased by R16,22 (0,4%) over a month and R366,30 (9%) year-on-year. Food baskets increased in all areas tracked with significant price hikes in cake flour, cooking oil, eggs, tea, bread, maize meal, rice, white sugar. According to PMBEJD, transport fares, electricity, food and other essential domestic hygiene products are also projected to increase well beyond the annual wage increment. In March, government decided to increase the National Minimum Wage by R1,50 an hour (from R21,69 an hour to R23,19 an hour), R12 a day, and R264 per month (based on a 22-day working month). “This increment in the light of the difficulties coming this year is unlikely to ease the suffering of workers, instead it is likely to deepen it,” said Abrahams. In its annual adjustments, government also decided to increase the R460 child support grant by R20 from April, however PMBEJD’s findings showed that this will still be below the food poverty line of R624. “With the projected rising food costs coming, it is likely that child food poverty, under nutrition, stunting, poor cognitive and physical growth, illness and poor health, inability to concentrate at school, struggles to function and adjust in society, will all worsen,” Abrahams said.
