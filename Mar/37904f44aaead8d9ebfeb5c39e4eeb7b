Former uMhlabuyalingana Municipality manager, Sipho Manqele (61) out on bail after he was arrested for two counts of fraud. Maqele made a brief appearance at the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Tuesday. According to the office of the directorate for priority crime investigation (Hawks), it is alleged that in 2010, Manqele submitted fraudulent payment certificates to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). Hawks spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, said the first service provider was paid R292 500 for the work that was incomplete and the second one was paid R794 866 for the services that were not rendered. As a result the department suffered an actual loss of more than R1 million, said Mhlongo. He said a case of fraud was reported at eManguzi police station, in northern KZN, and the docket was allocated to the Hawks members from Durban Serious Commercial Crime Investigation for investigation. “He was arrested yesterday (Tuesday) and released on R2000 bail. The case was postponed to 3 May 2022 for pre-trial conference and discovery,” said Mhlongo on Wednesday.
