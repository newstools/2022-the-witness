The operation was held to address and curb various crimes from taking place in an around the station’s policing area. Station Commander Brigadier Pregasen Pillay said that these type of operations positively result in the reduction of serious crimes in hot spot areas.

The second phase of the crime prevention operations focussed on roadblocks at strategic points.
