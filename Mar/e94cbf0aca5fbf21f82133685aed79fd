Two pedestrians were killed during a bus crash on Friday morning in Durban. Garrith Jamieson, ALS Paramedics spokesperson, said they responded to a multiple vehicle collision involving a bus, a light motor vehicle and pedestrians on Alice Street, Durban central. Jamieson said two women, believed to be in their 20’s and 30’s, had sustained fatal injuries and were declared dead on the scene. “A further 10 patients (were) treated on the scene before being transferred to a nearby hospital for the further care they require,” he said. Jamieson said police were on the scene to investigate the events leading up to the accident. Traffic has been backed up when entering the Durban central business district and motorists are being advised to avoid the area.
