Students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s (UKZN) Pietermaritzburg campus, who slept outside the main gate while awaiting residences, are still concerned about their accommodation issues. The Witness reported earlier this month that hundreds of students were sleeping outside the university’s main gate. Students from as far as Cape Town and Limpopo were part of the group, who said they had been stranded for almost a month without accommodation. On Monday a student, who asked not to be named, said they only spent one night outside the main gate of the campus. They were allowed to move into available private residences while they waited for the university to finalise all processes. However, the student said they had not received any feedback and they were not sure if their applications would be approved by the end of the month. “We have been trying to speak to the housing department for all the students to be captured in the system as students living at a private residences, but we don’t have any feedback yet. “The same thing happened last year and students were kicked out by landlords because they could not pay for the private residences,” the student said. She confirmed they have received their study material and are able to attend classes and catch up on the time they lost when they had no accommodation. On Monday, UKZN’s executive director for co-operate relations Normah Zondo said a number of students who had waited outside of the residence affairs offices were assisted by staff who arranged temporary overnight accommodation for them. “UKZN student residence accommodation is now full to capacity. Thus, no new students can be allocated place at the residences due to this limitation. This has been communicated to all students,” said Zondo. “Students who have not yet received official communication confirming allocation in residences have been advised to consider alternative options.”
