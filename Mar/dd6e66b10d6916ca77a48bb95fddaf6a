International celebrity actor Tom Cruise was seen landing at Ladysmith Airfield on Monday morning. The Mission Impossible actor is in South Africa filming his latest instalment of the action film. He and his film crew landed and spent a short time in Ladysmith, before flying off to the central Drakensberg to continue shooting for his movie. With his mask on, he had left a parked trailer that had been waiting for him on the airfield and walked towards the waiting helicopters. Cruise greeted a few of the locals who had gathered at the airfield, waving, and giving a friendly greeting, before doing a spot check on his chopper and getting in. Cruise waved before heading off towards the direction of the berg. “It was such a pleasant way to start a Monday morning, to think he stopped in Ladysmith,” said one locals who had managed to catch a quick glimpse of the actor.
