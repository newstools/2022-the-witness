Motorists have been warned of possible delays on the N3 from Durban towards Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday due to a march. The KwaZulu-Natal Ubumbano Driving School Operators Association will be marching from various Driving Licence testing Centres (DLTCs) to the premier’s office in Pietermaritzburg to hand over a memorandum of demands. Spokesperson for the association, Mzwandile Zondi, said they have several issues and felt the government was not recognising their work. He said they also wanted to address the introduction of online bookings which they felt will cause more corruption at the DLTCs and problems for those who want to book. “The minister of transport said there is corruption at the testing stations and wanted to stop it by introducing online booking. We want a discussion about this and for us to be told and taught about this programme so we can also be able to assist people who walk into our offices,” said Zondi. He added the online booking will cause problems for them and people in the rural areas. “Most people walk into our offices for assistance. Now imagine people in the rural areas coming in for assistance and we also don’t know how to help them. We also think they’ll be more corruption than there is currently,” Zondi said. Zondi also said there were other issues they needed to address including not receiving any relief funding from the government despite being affected by Covid-19 like other businesses. He said they were hoping to arrive at the premier’s office at 1pm. Zinhle Mali of the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) said they had not seen any disruptions by 9 am but will be monitoring.
