The Oliviershoek Pass, also known as the R74, that links the Free State to KwaZulu-Natal is closed to all vehicles over 3500kgs until further notice. This drastic decision was made by the Okhahlamba Municipality, in Bergville, after an active landslide was reported by the head of emergency services, Freddie Halgreen. “There is an active landslide which could spill into the road and push trucks off. The decision was made by the municipality to close the road as of Tuesday and also advise other motorists to seek alternative routes,” said Halgreen. Pictures supplied show deep cracks in the road surface and along the pass. It is reported that water from the heavy rains can be seen flowing down the pass and disappearing into the huge cracks. While officials were on scene, it is said that fences could be seen breaking as the slide slowly moves. Dr Jay Le Roux, who had been in the Bergville area for a conference, stopped at the affected area and after close inspection told officials that a landslide is imminent and that it would be better if it is closed off to heavy trucks. Despite the warning, officials said they are still struggling to get trucks to choose different routes. Motorists are also urged to also seek alternative routes.
