Local real estate agencies said the Pietermaritzburg market remains stable despite constant service delivery issues in the City. Bruce Campbell of the Natal Property Consultants and the local chairman of the Institute of Estate Agencies in South Africa said it was interesting to note that a number of home owners in Pietermaritzburg who have been selling their houses were moving to areas like Umhlanga, Ballito, Howick and Cape Town. “This was due to what they say is a ‘decaying City’ that is poorly run by our municipality,” said Campbell. He said the vacancy rates are climbing while rentals were slowing down. Campbell said: He said the recent data shows better than expected house price growth in recent years since the arrival of Covid-19. “Lightstone figures reflect that across the board we have seen an increase in property prices of 7,3% per annum in 2020 compared to 2019 and a further increase of 9,5% per annum from 2021 and 2022,” Campbell said. He said despite the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 and the general slowing down of the economy in recent years, as estate agents, they were pleasantly surprised at the consistent activity in the Pietermaritzburg market. “I felt that the low bank interest rate in 2020 and 2021 had induced buyer demand and affordability. Despite an increase in 50 base points in the last six months, the market has remained buoyant. The lower to middle priced segment of the market remains very strong but the upper end of the market has shown slowing buyer demand,” said Campbell. A resident who asked not be named said she was selling her house in Scottsville. She said: She said she was moving to the South Coast with hopes of a better life. “I’ll still be in South Africa but I’m hoping the South Coast will be much better that this City. I’m getting old and I can’t be worrying about where I will get the basic needs like water almost every week,” she said.
