The eThekwini Municipality has denied permission for Operation Dudula to use the Gugu Dlamini Park for their event on Sunday. This was revealed through a statement on Saturday morning by Brigadier Jay Naicker, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson. This Sunday, Operation Dudula planned to meet at the Gugu Dlamini Park and march through the city centre. Members of Operation Dudula said they aim to identify foreigners operating shops illegally in the city. Naicker said the organisers did not seek permission from eThekwini’s Parks and Recreation Unit to use the park. Naicker said security forces in KZN were on high alert this weekend for any signs of unrest. “Following voice notes and other messages threatening violence and criminality in KwaZulu-Natal, police officers and other security forces are prepared to react to any event which may contribute to the breakdown of law and order,” he said. “Police officers will be deployed strategically to respond swiftly and deal with those who act unlawfully.” Naicker also warned members of the public to refrain from making alarmist voice notes and spreading fake messages on social media. Mfanafuthi Dumakude, one of the organisers of the Operation Dudula movement in Durban, said they were still discussing whether to look for an alternative meeting place to Gugu Dlamini Park. Dumakude said as things stand the march is still going ahead on Sunday. The Weekend Witness reported that refugee organisations in Durban have warned foreign shopkeepers to stay at home this weekend for their own safety.
