Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma published the extension in the Government Gazette on Tuesday morning. The state of disaster is now set to expire on April 15, 2022. There were many speculations that all Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted but the decision to extend the National State of Disaster comes after the National Coronavirus Command Council met on Monday to discuss the country’s pandemic restrictions.
