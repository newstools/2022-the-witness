President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, as the country’s new Chief Justice on Thursday. Zondo, who is also the chairperson of the State Capture Commission which implicated top ANC leaders in state capture and corruption, was appointed by Ramaphosa following interviews conducted by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) for the top position. Candidates who were interviewed for the Chief Justice positions included Gauteng Judge President, Dunstan Mlambo and Supreme Court of Appeal Judge President, Mandisa Maya. Despite the JSC having recommended Maya for the top position, Ramaphosa opted for Zondo. Ramaphosa said: Zondo was first appointed as a judge of the Labour Court in 1997 and was Judge President of the Labour and Labour Appeals courts between 2000 and 2010. The new Chief Justice, who hails from KwaZulu-Natal, has been a judge of the Constitutional Court since 2012. In 2017 former president Jacob Zuma appointed Zondo as the country’s Deputy Chief Justice. Ramaphosa said the position of Chief Justice was one of the most important in the country. “The position of Chief Justice carries a great responsibility in our democracy. As the head of the judiciary, the Chief Justice is a guardian of our Constitution and the laws adopted by the freely elected representatives of the people,” he said. In 2018, Zondo penned the majority judgement declaring that the personal use of dagga was not a criminal case. Last year Zondo requested the Constitutional Court to imprison Zuma. Zondo starts on April 1.
