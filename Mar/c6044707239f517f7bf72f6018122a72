The Sharks will show three changes when they host Scarlets in the United Rugby Championship in Durban on Friday, partly due to the loss of skipper Lukhanyo Am temporarily. The match takes place at 7.10 pm at Kings Park. Siya Kolisi will now captain the team as a result of fellow Springbok star Am having signed a short-term deal in Japan. Am’s place at centre goes to Jeremy Ward on Friday. The other two changes come in the forward pack where Reniel Hugo replaces Ruben van Heerden in the second row, while eighthmen Sikhumbuzo Notshe and Phepsi Buthelezi switch positions this week. The half-back pairing remains Jaden Hendrikse (scrumhalf) and Curwin Bosch (flyhalf), while prop Thomas du Toit is vice-captain to Kolisi. Friday’s match starts a run of seven home games for the Sharks in the new competition, allowing them room to improve in the standings from their current No.8 place. Sharks Team 1. Ox Nche 2.
