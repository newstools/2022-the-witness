Eskom has announced that load shedding will move to stage 4
as of 9 am on Wednesday until 5 am on Friday in order to manage the emergency
reserves. The power utility said this is due to further failures of
generation units. Eskom said from Friday, loadshedding will be lowered to Stage
2 until 5 am on Monday. “Eskom would like to apologise for the implementation of
load shedding and will continuously review the situation and act appropriately
as circumstances change,” said the power utility. Eskom will be holding an emergency media briefing at 10 am on Wednesday. The power utility went on to explain that overnight, a unit
each at Kendal, Duvha, Camden and Kusile power stations tripped. Since then, Eskom said it has returned four units to
service. “However, these units still need to ramp up to full output,
which necessitates a high usage of emergency generation reserves today. This
being the fourth day of extremely high diesel usage, the emergency reserves are
being depleted faster than can be replenished. “Stage 4 loadshedding will therefore give us the space
required to replenish the emergency reserves and continue to manage the system
safely,” said Eskom. Total breakdowns amount to 15 439MW while planned
maintenance is 5 505MW of capacity. Eskom appealed to all South Africans to help limit the
impact of loadshedding by reducing the usage of electricity and to switch off
all non-essential items.
