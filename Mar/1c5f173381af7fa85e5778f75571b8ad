The post office has warned the public to beware of scams. Post office spokesperson, Johan Kruger, said in a statement that the South African post office has seen a rise in the number of enquiries regarding scams. “The scam messages state that the parcel can only be released once a clearance fee has been paid and include a link. Should the receiver click on the link, a page requesting payment opens where the receiver can make a payment to ‘release’ the fictitious parcel,” said Kruger. However, Kruger listed a few ways to spot an email or message that is not from the post office. “The post office never asks for import duties or clearance fees in advance. If there are custom fees payable on a parcel from abroad, the client pays the fees when they collect the parcel from the Post Office counter. “The post office never requests your bank account number or an online payment for customs duties and the tracking number on the message is invalid when entered into the postal tracking website,” read the statement. Kruger added that the post office sends the post office customers an SMS or a collection slip when they have a parcel waiting for collection at a post office branch. “This parcel should be collected as soon as possible to make sure it is not returned to the sender,” said Kruger. The post office continued to encourage members of the public with any information about postal crimes to contact its toll-free crime buster hotline on 0800 020 070.
