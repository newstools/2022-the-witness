The Pietermaritzburg High Court has given the go ahead for the coronation of Prince Misuzulu KaZwelithini, because his claim to the throne is not disputed. KwaZulu-Natal Deputy Judge President Isaac Madondo made this ruling on Wednesday. The ruling came after Princess Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma filed a court interdict against the coronation process of Prince Misuzulu. The pair also said the signature on one of King Goodwill Zwelithini's wills was forged and thus should be deemed null and void. Judge Madondo suspended the execution of King Zwelithini’s will. He said the two Zulu princesses, Ntandoyenkosi and Ntombizosuthu, were not able to show the court and provide valid reasons as to why King Misuzulu's coronation shouldn't take place. In another matter, the application by Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu to inherit 50% of the Zulu King’s estate has been dismissed with costs. In his ruling, Judge Madondo said the application against the Queen was premature and the estate matters could be dealt with by the executor. Dlamini-Zulu had argued before court that since she married the the king under civil marriage, he had no right to marry other wives after her and their marriage should be deemed null and void.
