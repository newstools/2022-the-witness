Some shops have been forced to close in Church Street in the Pietermaritzburg CBD following an alleged xenophobic attack. Currently the road from the corner of Church Street and Retief Street has been closed. Police are at the scene. According to a source at the scene, the commotion started after a foreign national shop owner had an altercation with a local person. It is alleged that a group of men then teamed up and decided to attack the shop owner. “They then burnt what he was selling and assaulted him. One guy open fire toward him and he fell on the ground. They threw his stuff into the street and started marching around while burning his things,” said a source. The source said the shop owner was taken to hospital for further care. The Witness spoke to a crowd at the scene, which included taxi drivers, which said they wanted shops owned by foreign nationals in the city to close down. This led to foreign nationals closing down their shops around the city as they fear for their lives.
