ActionSA has nominated its KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Busi Radebe, as a replacement for the sacked Dr Makhosi Khoza in eThekwini council. The party’s provincial chairperson, Musa Kubheka, said a vacancy became available after the termination of Khoza’s membership from the party. “The KZN provincial executive committee met on March 22, and unanimously endorsed our next candidate on the proportional representative list, Ms Busi Radebe, as the suitable candidate to fill the vacancy within council. Her name has subsequently been submitted to the office of the speaker and we will await the date of her swearing in,” said Kubheka. Radebe (33) holds a BCom honours qualification in Business Management at UKZN and UNISA. She previously worked in the KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs department’s disaster management unit and was a senior development officer for extended public works programmes. “Busi served as the provincial spokesperson for ActionSA where she excelled and, in this time, she demonstrated a deep passion and commitment for service delivery needs of the residents of eThekwini. ActionSA is confident that Busi will be an excellent councillor who will serve the residents of eThekwini with distinction. We have full confidence in her ability to represent the party within the eThekwini council,” said Kubheka in a statement.
