Community leaders in the Ngome area outside Greytown have appealed to people not to take the law into their own hands following the brutal murder of a man there. Dumsani Zondi (45) was found with severe head injuries outside his home at Nkonyane this week. It’s alleged he was beaten to death with a spade.
