Durban is gearing up to welcome over 86 000 visitors who are expected to hit its shores during the Easter weekend. eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said destination promotion campaigns are critical to attracting visitors to the city to boost the local tourism industry. “Projections show that double visitor numbers are anticipated for the Easter weekend this year compared to 2021. According to forecasts, over 86 000 holidaymakers are expected to flock to Durban during the Easter period from 14 to 18 April.” These projections, Kaunda said, indicate that anticipated visitor spending would be around R160 million and contribute about R400 million to the province’s gross domestic product while creating about 800 employment opportunities. He said plans and safety measures are in place in preparation to welcome tourists. Kaunda said fun activities and adventures are also lined up in key tourism nodes, including townships to keep holidaymakers entertained. Meanwhile, Durban Tourism is embarking on promotional roadshows to showcase the City’s winter holiday packages across KwaZulu-Natal. The interprovincial tour operators will have the opportunity to dive at the reefs of Umkomaas Aliwal Shoal, go horse riding on the beach, tour the historic Inanda heritage route, participate in Valley of 1000 Hills activities, experience Durban’s nightlife and the heartbeat of township experience to name a few. Local community tourism organisations will have the opportunity to present their products to the tour operators during networking sessions which will be held as part of the exercise. The intra-provincial destination promotion will take place over three days starting at Pietermaritzburg’s Liberty Midlands Mall on April 1, Boardwalk Inkwazi Mall in Richards Bay on April 2 before wrapping up at Shelly Beach in Margate on April 3. These will target local tourists.
