Former Miss South Africa, Shudufhadzo Musina, will be gracing our screens on the Miss World stage. Musina was crowned Miss SA in 2020 but was robbed of the chance to enter the Miss World contest due to Covid-19. Concerns had been raised about the health and safety of everyone involved in the contest. The finale takes place in North America, at Puerto Rico Coliseum Jose Miguel Agrelot. “We are very much looking forward to the return of our contestants, (who we have grown to know and love), to compete for the Miss World crown” said Julia Morley, CEO of Miss World, in a statement. Shudufhadzo has completed a Degree in Social Sciences focusing on philosophy, economics, politics and international relations. She is currently continuing her studies but is also the founder and chairwoman of her own foundation. One of her dreams is to work for the United Nations. Shudufhazdo is also an advocate for mental health and has had many opportunities to speak about it on international platforms.
