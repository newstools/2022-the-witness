The Durban University of Technology has temporarily closed four of its campuses following a violent protest that broke out on Thursday afternoon. These are the Steve Biko campus, ML Sultan, Ritson Campus and City Campus. According to a statement released by the university, the protesters did not only violate the Covid-19 protocols, but they also damaged property and traumatised staff, in what was a well-orchestrated, violent attack. “Despite the university’s appeals to the South African Police Services for assistance, DUT was unable to prevent these attacks, even though law enforcement was notified as early as Wednesday, 23 March, about the planned protest,” read the statement. The university has urged all staff who suffered emotional trauma during the violent protest to contact the university’s employee wellness office (EWP) at the human capital services, to receive support and assistance from professionals. “Although the four campuses will be temporarily closed with immediate effect, the academic programme will continue online. Staff who are based on the affected campuses will work remotely and only essential services staff will be allowed access onto the four campuses,” read the statement. Meanwhile, the university has said that it would monitor the situation and notify staff and students accordingly once the campuses open. “The university will closely monitor the situation and will not hesitate to evacuate the residences, should it be necessary, based on the potential risks on our students, staff and university property,” read the statement.
