The Verulam regional court sentenced a 32-year-old man to life imprisonment, for the rape of his 10-year-old biological daughter in November 2019. The incident took place in the Cottonlands area. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), said the girl and her eight-year-old brother visited their father who lived with their granny. “When they got there, they found him alone in his room as their granny had gone out. After speaking to them for a while, the man gave the boy his cellphone and sent him to another room, while he closed the door and raped the girl. He gave her a sanitary pad to wear as she had started bleeding. “He then took the children back home to their mother and the rape incident came to light when the mother questioned the girl about the sanitary pad,” said Ramkisson-Kara. She said the matter was reported to the police and the girl was then taken to the Thuthuzela Care Centre at the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital in Phoenix where she received assistance. Ramkisson-Kara said the man evaded the police for two months but was eventually arrested. “His defence in court was a bare denial and regional court prosecutor Nondumiso Cele led the testimonies of the girl’s brother, her mother who was the first report and medical evidence from the doctor,” she said. In aggravation of sentence, Ramkisson-Kara said a victim impact statement was handed to the court. In the statement, compiled by the girl and facilitated by court preparation officer Bongiwe Qwabe, the girl stated that she was embarrassed and could no longer play with other children in the area as they knew what happened to her. She said she wanted the court and God to punish her father.
