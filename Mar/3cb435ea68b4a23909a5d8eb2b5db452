Long serving Democratic Alliance member, Mbali Ntuli (33), has resigned from the party and as a member of KwaZulu-Natal’s legislature. In a statement released on Thursday morning, Ntuli announced she would be leaving the party after 15 years. “My decision to do so was not one I came to lightly but one that is necessary for my growth as a leader,” she said. Ntuli did not state where she would be going next but said she is “not lost to politics”. Ntuli is the latest of high profile leaders who have left the party over the past year following the resignations of Bongani Baloyi and Phumzile van Damme. Ntuli, who hails from Durban, said she joined the DA as a 19-year-old while studying at Rhodes University. In 2020, Ntuli launched an ambitious bid to be the DA national leader but lost to John Steenhuisen. Ntuli said her campaign for national leader was to change the culture within the DA. “My colleagues in the DA know better than most the difficult and relentless challenges I have faced in the party, in part because so many have played out in the public domain but also because our party (like any other organisation) is not immune to gossip,” she said. “I have been forthright about instances where the DA has erred in its treatment of its members and the negative culture that is fostered within the organisation.”
