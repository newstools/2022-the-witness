The Durban University of Technology has condemned the spreading of misinformation and false statements online. According to a statement released by senior director for corporate affairs, Alan Khan on Monday, false statements related to student registration, available spaces, confirmation of banking details and misinformation are spreading online. “The university is extremely concerned that the ‘fake news’ is purely intended to confuse DUT students and staff, to create chaos and to disrupt the university, thereby compromising operations and further unsettling the first semester,” read the statement. The university also confirmed that the late online registration for first year students will end on Friday, March 11. The statement read: The university urged all staff and students to only consider and access official DUT statements through their internal communication platforms and those published on the official DUT website, www.dut.ac.za. “DUT students are advised to not circulate information that has not been verified and to avoid being part of the chain of fake news, the statement read. “They also need to avoid spreading information that fraudsters may use to manipulate unsuspecting victims,” it added.
