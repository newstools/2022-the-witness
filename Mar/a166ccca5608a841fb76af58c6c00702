The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) is revising its stance on the participation of unvaccinated athletes in the 2022 Comrades Marathon. This is in line with changes to the regulations of the management of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. This announcement comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on Tuesday night, in which he announced some key changes to the restrictions which government had put in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. According to CMA chairperson, Mqondisi Ngcobo, the association will allow unvaccinated runners to run the 2022 Comrades on condition that they provide proof of a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours of Comrades race day, at their own cost. “The same rules will apply to all runners, volunteers and visitors to the three-day Comrades Expo, scheduled for race week (25-27 August 2022),” said Ngcobo in a statement. Ngcobo has said that the association will continue to comply with government regulations to safeguard the health and safety of runners, supporters, officials and the public at large. “Should government regulations or Athletics South Africa guidelines change prior to race day, the CMA will likewise apply the regulations applicable at that time,” said Ngcobo in the statement. According to the statement, part of the revised regulations means that runners will not be required to wear face masks when outdoors. Comrades’ international athletes will be required to show proof of vaccination or be in possession of a negative PCR test not older than 72 hours to enter the country. The association also mentioned that all unvaccinated visitors to South Africa would be offered a vaccination on arrival. The 95th Comrades Marathon will be a Down Run on Sunday, 28 August 2022. The race will start at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall at 5.30 am and end 12 hours later at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, covering a 90,2km distance. It will be the 47th Down Run in Comrades history.
