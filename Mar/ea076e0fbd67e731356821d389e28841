Sharks coach Sean Everitt has made three line-up changes for Saturday’s clash with Zebre Parma in the United Rugby Championship (URC) in Durban. Ntuthuko Mchunu will join the pack due to an injury to experienced lock Ox Nche, with the other changes among the backs. Grant Williams gets the scrumhalf jersey and Ben Tapuai comes in at outside centre, after Everitt on Thursday named his team for the 6.30 pm kick-off on Saturday against the Italian stragglers Curwin Bosch will remain in the flyhalf position despite critics slating his level of performance. Springbok captain Siya Kolisi will officially lead the Sharks for the second time this weekend in the absence of regular team skipper Lukhanyo Am, who is in Japan on a short-term deal approved by the Sharks. Last weekend, the Bok-laden Durban franchise jumped into a season-high sixth spot in the URC standings when they won 37-20 against Scarlets from Wales at the start of a series of home matches at Kings Park. Zebre remained at the base of the 16-team standings after they were hammered 55-7 by the Stormers in Cape Town. The referee in Durban on Saturday will be Ben Whitehouse. Sharks Team: 1.
