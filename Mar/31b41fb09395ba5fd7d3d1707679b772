The Automobile Association (AA) has again appealed to the Minister of Transport to reconsider government’s refusal to extend today’s deadline to renew driving licences that had expired between March 26, 2020 and August 31, 2021. Minister Fikile Mbalula had announced in August last year that these driving licences would be valid until Thursday, but in February admitted that 2,1 million people would be affected by the deadline. “Given the recent problems with the production of driving licence cards, and issues around Driving Licence Testing Centres (DLTCs) and online booking systems, we believe it’s unrealistic to expect that this enormous backlog will be cleared by tomorrow,” the AA said, adding that hundreds of thousands of drivers could face fines and insurance issues if they are left with no choice but to drive without the necessary documents. The association noted: The AA says the only practical solution was for government to further extend the renewal period, and to ensure all DLTCs and systems are geared to accommodate the backlogs. The association also called on Mbalula to speed up the implementation of a ten-year validity period for drivers’ licences. Mbalula had in February indicated that research was being conducted into extending the validity period of driver’s licences.
