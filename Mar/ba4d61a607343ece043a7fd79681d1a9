E-hailing ride prices have shot up as e-hailing drivers across the country embark on a national shutdown which started on Tuesday. A simple ride which normally costs a commuter R30, costs more than R100 as demand for the services increased. Drivers are demanding the service be regulated, citing concerns of ill treating drivers, offering low incentives, and exploitation. Drivers are also demanding that the minimum price for a ride be R50, rather than R30. The shutdown, organised by the Unity in Diversity E-Hailing Association, will see drivers from Uber, Bolt, DiDi and other e-hailing apps suspending their service until Friday. According to the association, drivers are demanding that the government regulates the industry to ensure fair pricing, accountability and proper vetting of drivers. It said that as drivers, they deserve better earnings considering the price of petrol. In KwaZulu-Natal, drivers gathered at King Dinuzulu Park, Durban, before marching to City Hall where they submitted their memorandum of demands to the provincial department of transport.
