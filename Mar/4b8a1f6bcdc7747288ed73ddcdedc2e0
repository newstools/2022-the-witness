President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to appear before the national investigative hearing into the July 2021 unrest on Friday. This will be part of the South African Human Rights Commission’s (SAHRC) national investigative hearings into the July 2021 unrest. “The president will appear before the hearing panel and give testimony with regard to his responsibility as the head of state and the head of South Africa’s executive with regard to the July 2021 unrest in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces,” reads the SAHRC statement. During the month of July 2021, chaos broke out in Gauteng and KZN after former president, Jacob Zuma, was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment after being found guilty in contempt of court. The unrest claimed more than 300 lives and left a trail of destruction as shopping centres and warehouses were looted and torched. Cities such as Pietermaritzburg and Durban were among the hardest hit.
