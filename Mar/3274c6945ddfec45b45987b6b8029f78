Netflix has released the official trailer for its five-part docu-series that touches on the life and rise of celebrated soccer star Senzo Meyiwa as well as probes the circumstances around his tragic death. The captain of the Bafana Bafana soccer national team was shot dead at a house belonging to the mother of his girlfriend singer Kelly Khumalo in October 2014. There were six eyewitnesses at the scene, including some of his closest friends, yet it has taken more than seven years for the suspects – alleged hitmen for hire – to be tried for his murder. The true-crime documentary series explores the varied speculations, theories, and different sides of the story made public by journalists and influential law-enforcement officials who worked closely on the murder case. The doccie also carries interviews of his friends and family as they all remark on the unsolved and protracted case that has been ongoing since 2014. The series also features sports broadcaster Robert Marawa, the former provincial Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya, and Advocate Gerrie Nel. ‘Senzo: Murder of a Soccer Star’ is set to stream globally on Netflix from April 7, 2022.
