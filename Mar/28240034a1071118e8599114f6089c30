Another Pietermaritzburg taxi boss was gunned down at his home in Imbali Unit BB on Friday afternoon. It is alleged that Mthokozisi Sithole (53), who was a taxi owner operating at unit BB, was outside his house doing a routine check-up on his taxi when he was gunned down. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said two unknown men came and shot Sithole several times. Mbele said Sithole suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body and died at the scene. “The suspects fled on foot. It is also alleged by the witness that the same suspects came earlier on and did nothing as Sithole was not at home at that time and when they came for the second time, they found him outside his yard then shot him,” said Mbele. She said a murder case was open at Plessislaer SAPS for investigation. Mbele said two 9mm empty cartridges and four rifle cartridges were found at the scene. She said the murder was possibly taxi violence related. This is a second taxi-related shooting that has taken place in Imbali Unit BB this week.
