The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of more thundershowers and heavy rains expected in the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday evening. The weather office said a band of thunderstorms was lying over the southern parts of KZN and Lesotho, moving eastwards. “Due to the steep slope of the escarpment over the southern Drakensberg together with the persisting upper air [movements] over the southern parts of KZN, downbursts may be enhanced over the southwestern parts of KZN and that may result in severe thunderstorms, with the thunderstorms expected to drift towards the east during the course of the afternoon and affect the whole southern parts of KZN [on Thursday],” said Saws. Areas expected to be affected in KZN include Dr N. Dlamini-Zuma - Underberg, Greater Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Mkhambathini, Ray Nkonyeni, Richmond, Msunduzi, Ubuhlebezwe, Umdoni, UMuziwabantu, Umzimkhulu and Umzumbe. Residents are urged to be cautious, avoid travelling on bridges and roads in low lying areas and also avoid outdoor activities as wind and flooding may result in injuries and death.
