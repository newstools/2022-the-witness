Pietermaritzburg's CBD was without water on Friday. According to councillor Dante Kemp of ward 27, this was due to a burst pipe in three areas. The affected areas include the high court, City Hall, AS Chetty, national government departments, as well as Russel High school, Three Oaks and St. Christopher’s, which have resorted to closing for the day. Kemp wrote to senior management of the municipality demanding an update on the current status of the outage. “I’ve got schools which have closed again, and I am being informed that AS Chetty wants to close too due to no water,” The municipality issued a statement informing residents that it is aware of the water outage. “We are currently experiencing two burst water pipes between Chief Albert Luthuli, Peter Kerchoff and Greyling streets which has resulted in water outages in some parts of the CBD. The water services are attending to it; at this stage we cannot confirm the water restoration time,” read the statement. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused and appeal for patience. Msunduzi spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize said that staff members have been dismissed. “Staff at City Hall, Gallwey, AS Chetty and Publicity House have been dismissed due to the water outage,” said Mkhize.
