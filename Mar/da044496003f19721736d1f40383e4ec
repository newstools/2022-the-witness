A South African businessman and social media personality, Malcom X, has pledged R500 000 to help convicted Walter Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani stay out of jail. Mani was on Wednesday sentenced to five years' imprisonment for theft relating to R14 million accidentally credited to her account by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in 2017. East London Regional Court Magistrate Twanette Olivier found Mani guilty of stealing R818 000 of the funds. She was only entitled to a R1 400 food allowance and was accused of failing to report when R14 million was credited to her account erroneously. She instead embarked on a spending spree. Malcom X, who is known for always giving hard cash as well as settling people’s student loans and helping the needy, took to Instagram on Wednesday afternoon to announce that he is pledging R500 000 towards the R818 000 that “Mani ‘accidentally’ used from the R14m that was ‘accidentally’ transferred to her bank account provided the payment of this money will lead to her immediate release from prison.” Malcom X urged other entrepreneurs to donate the other R318 000 to round up the R818 000 that she Mani used for herself and other students. Malcom X earlier this year also pledged to help rebuild parliament after the tragic fire.
