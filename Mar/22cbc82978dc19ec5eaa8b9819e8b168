A Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) officer was injured after a truck crashed into her car on the N3 near Merrivale in the Midlands on Friday. Roland Robertson from the Midlands EMS said her RTI car was parked on the side of the N3, with flashing blue lights, when the truck crashed into it from behind. He said paramedics found the RTI car off the road with extensive damage. Three other trucks were also involved in the same accident. “One patient, an RIT officer, sustained serious injuries and required urgent advanced life support treatment before being transported to hospital for further care,” said Robertson. RTI was yet to comment.
