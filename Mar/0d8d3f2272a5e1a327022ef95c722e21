Tropical Storm Gombe has just made landfall over northern Madagascar (Figure 1) and is expected to move into the Mozambique Channel on Wednesday, according to the South African Weather Service (Saws). The weather office said once in the channel, Gombe is expected to strengthen as a result of the warm sea surface temperatures (SST) combined with moisture from the ocean. Gombe is forecasted to reach tropical cyclone intensity by Friday when it is projected to briefly make landfall over northern Mozambique (Figure 2). Saws said this landfall will be short lived, as currently Gombe is once again expected to enter the Mozambique Channel by Sunday. At this stage, Gombe poses no direct threat to South Africa, said the weather office. “South Africans can be assured that the South African Weather Service will continue to closely monitor the situation and issue updates as and when necessary.” Saws said it will continue to closely monitor developments in this regard and will issue updates as and when necessary.
