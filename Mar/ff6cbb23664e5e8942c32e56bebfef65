SA Rugby on Tuesday welcomed the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that rugby venues like Kings Park in Durban can now accept up to half its capacity for vaccinated or Covid-19 negative attendees from Wednesday. President of the SA Rugby Union, Mark Alexander said apart from Vodacom United Rugby Championship, and Carling Currie Cup, fans have six Test matches to look forward to from July, adding it would be great for the Boks to run out in front of “a proper crowd” for the first time since 2019.” Alexander said rugby remains “in ICU” as clubs battle for income, but now there was “a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel”.
