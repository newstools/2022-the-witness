The principal of Grosvenor Girls High School, Linda
Jorgensen, has been suspended. This, as an independent panel is investigating allegations
of racism and financial irregularities at the Durban school. On Monday morning, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education
released a statement saying Jorgensen was placed on precautionary suspension
pending the outcome of the investigations. The department said the decision was taken following advice
from the recently appointed panel investigating the school. “The panel has been at work and in consultation with the
department over the weekend. Upon looking at the correspondence submitted to it
by the department, the panel deemed it fit to recommend the suspension of the
principal in order to facilitate an investigation that will not be marred by
any difficulties for those who will voluntarily tender the evidence,” the
statement reads. The panel is led by Vusi Khuzwayo SC (Senior Counsel),
supported by Advocate Makhosini Nkosi, who is an evidence leader; Dr Nontobeko
Buthelezi, an Educational Psychologist; Jacqueline PretoriusBishop and the
Secretariat that is provided by SD Moloi and Associates. Last week, Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu, visited the school
to speak to parents and other stakeholders over allegations of racism in the
school. Mshengu’s visit was overshadowed by scenes of heated
confrontations between members of his department and parents and political
organisations. The department said pupils at the school will be issued with
letters informing them of the suspension along with a request to allow pupils
who wish to testify to do so. Parents, former and current pupils at the school will also
be allowed to any information or evidence that could be relevant to the
investigation, the department said.
