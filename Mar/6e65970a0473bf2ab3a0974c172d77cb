The Victoria Country Club Estate (VCCE) in Pietermaritzburg has launched the fifth and final phase of the development, Fairways Lifestyle Village, catering for the over-55s. Marketed by Pam Golding Properties, Fairways Lifestyle Village is a sectional title scheme comprising a mix of 86 units including cottages and luxury maisonettes, apartments and penthouses, as well as a village centre with medical, wellness and personal care facilities. Area principal manager for Pam Golding Properties Belinda Driemeyer said: “Two maisonettes and six apartments have also been reserved, with construction on these units due to commence during the first half of this year. “Situated on a prime north-facing location above the 18th fairway of the Victoria Country Club golf course, this village has been carefully designed to create a superior residential choice for discerning seniors, offering individually tailored, home-based care options from full independent living to full 24/7 in-house care. Driemeyer said: “To date, in the first four phases of VCCE, 216 upmarket homes have been built and occupied with a further 40 under construction, while 10 free-standing office buildings and 60 office sectional title units have been built and occupied. There are 91 residential sites and nine office sites still vacant and available for purchase and development.” In 2006 the golf course was upgraded by South African company Golf Data, who work closely with the world-renowned Jack Nicklaus.
