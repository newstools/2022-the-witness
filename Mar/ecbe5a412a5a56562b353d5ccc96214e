It’s still hatching season, one of the most exciting for snake rescuer, Nick Evans. He said that eggs laid by mother snakes, two to three months ago, have all started hatching. “I've been lucky enough to witness a few clutches hatching, or at least see all the babies out. These were from heavily gravid (pregnant) snakes I caught a while ago. I let them lay their eggs, then set them free. Now, I have their babies to set free,” said Evans. Meanwhile, Evans says that people should not worry about the hatchlings’ parents. “Snakes will come together to mate, then go their separate ways so the father is out of the picture. Then, two to three months later, the mother will lay her eggs, and leave them (apart from pythons and Spotted Skaapstekers). As mentioned, the eggs take two to three months to hatch, so by that time, both parents are long gone,” said Evans. However, Evans has urged people to be cautious with venomous snakes as they become venomous from day one. “Venomous species are venomous from day one. Don't try picking up or killing a baby mamba or cobra thinking it can't bite or harm you. Either leave hatchling snakes alone or call a professional for advice or to remove it,” said Evans.
