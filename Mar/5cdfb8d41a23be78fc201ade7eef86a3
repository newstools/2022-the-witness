Is this the last kick of summer? Hot temperatures are expected throughout this week in Pietermaritzburg. You’d better get your sun hats out and sun block lotion on as we take a break from the rain and cooler weather experienced in the past week. The Witness spoke to a weather forecaster from the South African Weather Services, Thandiwe Gumede who said it is difficult to predict whether it is the last kick of the summer season before winter, however Pietermaritzburg will be experiencing warm temperatures this week. “Pietermaritzburg will have warm temperatures this week, but it will not be unbearable. This week’s temperatures will be ranging from a maximum of about 30 degrees to about 32 degrees,” said Gumede. According to Gumede, the temperatures are expected to cool down a bit on Thursday to a maximum of about 27 degrees.
