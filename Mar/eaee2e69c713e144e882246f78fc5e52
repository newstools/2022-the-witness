KZN South Coast’s Ugu District has been criticised for allegedly passing an unfunded adjustment budget of over R1,3 billion. DA Ugu caucus leader George Henderson said the district municipality has a high debtors book of R747 million that remains uncollected as well as a creditors balance of R602 million that is unpaid. Due to a material under-collection of revenue during the current financial year, said Henderson, the municipality has no option but to reduce its expenditure by R84 million or run the risk of not receiving its equitable share from National Treasury at the end of March. He said: While tabling the budget, Ugu mayor Phumlile Mthiyane said through the budget, the municipality intends to implement water and sanitation projects across the district which will bring much-needed relief to residents. Mthiyane said the projects include Msikaba and surrounds water supply scheme in Port Sheptsone’s Ray Nkonyeni Municipality, for which they have allocated close to R31,2 million. She added that under Umdoni, they have set aside over R4,3 million for the KwaLembe bulk water extension. She said that the Ugu District has also reconsidered their water and sanitation tariff increase from 8,5% (R17,34) to 6,5% (R17,02). However, DA’s Henderson said in the budget, there is no provision to settle any debts, and an undisclosed amount of operating revenue will be used for building new offices. He said no cost-benefit analysis has been done to illustrate that the building costs are more efficient than the current lease that is in place.
