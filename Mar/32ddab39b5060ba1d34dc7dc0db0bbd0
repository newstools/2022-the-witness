The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government has issued a stern warning to anyone breaking the law and disobeying the rules of the road this long weekend.

The KZN Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison said they are aware of this trend and plans are in place to ensure that wrongdoers are arrested. The department’s spokesperson, Thuba Vilane said law enforcement agencies have been deployed in various places in the province, especially on the roads. Vilane said: He said driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding are a major contributor to road crashes. N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) anticipates traffic volumes to increase to well over 2000 vehicles per hour at peak times. It said high traffic volumes may result in slow-moving traffic and extended travel times, in turn placing additional burdens on travellers and traffic management resources. Spokesperson Anita Heyl said the majority of crashes on the N3 Toll Route are caused by human error, such as drivers losing control and rolling their vehicles, head-tail collisions and/or vehicles leaving the road. Heyl said speed, reckless and negligent driver behaviour and unroadworthy vehicles also contribute to crashes. Heyl said:
