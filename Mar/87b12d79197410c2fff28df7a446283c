The South African Weather Services has released a warning that severe thunderstorms are expected on Friday afternoon in KwaZulu-Natal. The affected areas will be Dr N. Dlamini-Zuma - Underberg, eThekwini, Greater Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Mkhambathini, Mpofana - Giants Castle, Ray Nkonyeni, Richmond, Msunduzi, Ubuhlebezwe, Umdoni, uMngeni, UMuziwabantu, Umzimkhulu and Umzumbe. According to a statement released by SAWS, there is a possibility that these areas might experience localised flooding of settlements, susceptible roads, low-lying areas and bridges. “Minor vehicle accidents and localised damage to infrastructure is also possible,” read the statement. SAWS has urged people to take caution and to avoid travelling on bridges and roads in low lying areas as these may be susceptible to flooding as there may be sinkholes. “Avoid swimming and crossing on rivers. Avoid outdoor activities as flooding may result in injuries or danger to life. If possible, stay indoors well clear of windows, shelter pets, and cover vehicles,” read the statement. Meanwhile, weather forecaster Thandiwe Gumede, explained the cause of these severe thunderstorms. “A cold front is passing with a surface high ridging over the south-eastern parts and behind it is an upper trough with winds out of place or rather winds moving in different directions compared to the others, over the southern parts of KZN, enhancing thunderstorm development,” said Gumede. “This will result in scattered to widespread showers and thundershowers over the southern parts of KZN today afternoon into the evening,” added Gumede. According to the statement these thunderstorms are expected to happen from 2pm until about 11pm.
