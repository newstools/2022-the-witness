Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) has released a statement condemning the exploitation of job seekers by fraudulent recruiters. According to the statement, there are individuals claiming to be representatives of the company advertising fraudulent offers of employment in exchange for payment. “The offers come from unauthorised individuals fraudulently recruiting on CCBSA’s behalf or claiming to work for or be associated with the company,” read the statement. CCBSA has warned the public and communities about this scam, saying that these activities are not authorised and not linked in any way to CCBSA or any of its entities. “All such activities must therefore be regarded as criminal and unlawful and should be reported to the authorities,” read the statement. CCBSA continued to emphasise that their entities would never ask for upfront fees or payment before, during and/or after the recruitment process. “We have legitimate fair and formal recruitment processes in place which meets all legal and industry requirements. Should an individual be successful in gaining an offer of employment from the company, this communication would originate from a verifiable CCBSA source,” read the statement. In addition, the company urged all job seekers to not be lured or attracted by any communication that solicits payment or otherwise and to contact them directly on 0800 005 174 to confirm whether an offer is legitimate or not. “Furthermore, job seekers suspicious of any fraudulent activities linked to job offers at CCBSA may contact the police services on 10111 or report the matter at a police station nearby,” read the statement. CCBSA has assured the public that they are taking this matter seriously and that the matter is under investigation. “We will be working with the relevant authorities to end this fraudulent activity,” read the statement.
