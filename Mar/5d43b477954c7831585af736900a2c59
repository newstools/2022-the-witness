A third man was arrested on Thursday in connection with the attack and robbery at a farm in Camperdown in KwaZulu-Natal. A farmer in his late 70s and his employee were attacked at his farm in Umlaas Road on Wednesday afternoon. Shaheen Sulieman of Magma Security said their investigation team together with the Camperdown SAPS detectives arrested another man who worked as a gardener at the farm. It is believed he collaborated with the two men that carried out the attack. The other two men were arrested shortly after the robbery close to the farm. They were found with stolen items. “The farm owner had been busy with his employee fixing his engine of the lawnmower in the workshop when two men entered the workshop. One of them had a handgun and demanded that the two victims lie on the ground,” said Sulieman. He added the robbers then bound both the farmer and his employee’s hands with sellotape and demanded all the keys for the main house which the owner complied with. He said the robbers then went to the main house where they took a laptop, pioneer DVD, binoculars, rechargeable light, headphones and a golf bag. “The employee managed to untie himself and his employer and phoned a neighbour who immediately responded and also alerted Magma security and called the SAPS and farming community from the area. The suspects fled the scene on foot after realising that the neighbour and security officers were responding,” Sulieman said. The two men arrested on Wednesday are expected to appear at Camperdown Magistrates Court on Friday. The third man is expected to appear at court on Monday.
