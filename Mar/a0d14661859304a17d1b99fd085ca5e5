Pietermaritzburg police search and rescue teams are searching for a woman whose car was swept away on Wednesday night while she was trying to cross the overflowing Henley Dam bridge. The incident happened at around 7 pm. People who witnessed Zasembo Ngcobo’s car being swept away alerted other community members and her family. They started searching for her on Wednesday and were later joined by the police search and rescue teams. The rescue team later called off the search saying it was too dark. The Witness was told that some community members spent the whole night trying to search for her body. A family member, Nombuyiselo Mahlaba, told The Witness that Ngcobo was coming home from work when the incident happened. She said Ngcobo works at Nongoma as a lecturer and was returning home for the holidays. “This is the route she used every time she came home. We were told that the water was not high on the bridge. I guess it was just an unfortunate incident for us. “The search is continuing, but she has not been found. She is not inside the car. If we can only find her body, that is all we are asking for now,” she said. *This is a developing story.
