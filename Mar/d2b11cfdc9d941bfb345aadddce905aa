KZN Midlands’ filmmaker Cuba Ikaneng, who is also known as “Makhubalo The Storyteller”, has flown the uMngeni municipality flag high after scooping the 2022 Time of the Writer’s literature champion of the year award. The award was presented by the Centre for Creative Arts at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, in Durban, on Monday night. The award is usually given to an individual or organisation that promotes literature development at grassroots community level. In his acceptance speech, Ikaneng mentioned that he has dedicated his life to sharing his skills with young people from his community. “In the past 21 years of my life, I have had the absolute pleasure of being able to start conversations and encourage people to reflect using films (as a producer), using TV (as a director), using theatre (as a practitioner) and using books (as an author).” He said in the past five years, he has had the pleasure of sharing those skills with young people in his community, in uMngeni Municipality. “This literature champion of the year award, this recognition, is inspiration for me to continue doing what I do. For the community to believe that everyone can make a difference and for every child growing up in a rural community to know that the sky is the limit,” said Ikaneng. Ikaneng has directed several movies and TV shows including Take 5, The Molo Show, Enterprise Zone, Vukuzenzele, Ba Kae, The Chat Room, Gospel Time, Gospel Old and Big Up.
