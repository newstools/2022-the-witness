The body of a female passenger who got submerged underwater inside a car was retrieved two metres below the surface, in Underberg, KZN. The woman, believed to be in her late twenties, was retrieved along with the car near a dam in Underberg on Saturday by SAPS search and rescue teams. Ryan McAlister, Underberg Emergency Medical Services paramedic, said they were dispatched to a lodge for a motor vehicle crash incident on Friday night. “On arrival, crews found a single vehicle that had slipped off a dam wall, into a dam. The vehicle was completely submerged,” said McAlister. McAlister said there were two occupants in the vehicle, a man and a woman aged between 27 to 30 years. “The gentleman managed to get out of the car while his partner was trapped and sunk with the car,” said McAlister. He said the couple were on their way to book themselves into the lodge. The road on the dam wall, he said, was narrow and had no barriers. “The gentleman told us he over-corrected his car and the tyre burst causing the car to fall into the water,” said McAlister. McAlister said when they arrived at the scene on Friday, the car was too far down in the water and due to the weather conditions and poor night visibility, search and rescue teams began their operations the next day. “Underberg EMS would like to send their most sincere condolences to the loved ones of the deceased. Our thoughts and prayers are with you at this very sad time,” he said.
