Four armed men were shot dead during a shootout with the police and private security guards in Durban on Wednesday morning. The men are suspected to have been involved in several business robberies in the Durban north and south areas. The bodies of two of the dead men were sprawled not far from the wrecked getaway white Mercedes Benz while their accomplice who survived the shooting was lying on his stomach with both his hands tied with a cable tie. Another dead man was lying in the back seat of the getaway vehicle while the other one was lying dead just below the N2 bridge. The vehicle came to a standstill after it collided with another, which the police said escaped the scene. Provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said one of the security guards who was involved in the shooting, was injured in the hand. Markings on the tarmac indicated that about 20 bullets were fired on the off-ramp, south bound to Higginson Highway. According to Gwala, the gunmen had stolen the Mercedes Benz in Pinetown in December. Four firearms and jamming devices were recovered. “This started as a chase between the security guards and the suspicious vehicle when it was spotted at the corner of Cowie and Clarence Road in Berea. The guards were suspicious of the vehicle.  When they approached it, the driver sped off. The guards alerted the police and they got involved in the high-speed chase which culminated in the shootout. One man escaped and was firing at the police in the process, and was hit and died below the N2 bridge,” said Gwala. She said the vehicle is suspected to have been involved in the recent business robberies in the North and South of Durban. This is a developing story.
