Millions of beneficiaries of the R350 Covid-19 relief grant will now be able to collect their cash at 1 286 Shoprite, Checkers, Usave or selected OK Foods supermarkets. This was announced by the Shoprite Group on Sunday which said customers can now access their grants at the till point in supermarkets across South Africa. To collect their grant in any Shoprite, Checkers, Usave or selected OK Foods, customers simply need to provide their ID and cellphone number. It must be the same cellphone number with which they registered on the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) database, as a confirmation one-time password (OTP) will be sent to this number to prevent fraud. Grants are available from this month (March) for all customers who have already registered online or at the Post Office. In-store registrations are not available.
