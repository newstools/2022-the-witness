Sharks coach Sean Everitt has made just two changes to his outfit to face Edinburgh in the United Rugby Championship at Kings Park in Durban on Saturday. Everitt named his team for the potentially-absorbing game on Thursday and the starting line-up has Springbok prop Ox Nche back from injury and Anthony Volmink replacing Aphelele Fassi in a forced change. Ntuthuko Mchunu goes to the bench after replacing Nche in the last game, while Fassi is nursing an ankle injury. Everitt has also brought in the Sharks’ Currie Cup captain, James Venter, “to bolster the stocks” on the bench to address “the European rugby focus on set-piece and forward domination”. As such, there is a “five-two split” on the bench. Curwin Bosch remains in the pivotal flyhalf position and Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi continues to wear the armband in Durban as well, due to Sharks captain Lukhanyo Am playing in Japan on a temporary basis, but winger Sbu Nkosi is absent from the line-up again due to reported contractual issues. Last weekend, Kolisi’s side defeated Italian stragglers Zebre Parma 38-6 on home soil, while Edinburgh went down 30-17 on their visit to Glasgow Warriors for a Scottish derby. Thoses results lifted the Sharks into sixth spot in the 16-team standings and left Edinburgh in fifth place, respectively. Saturday’s match in Durban kicks off at 5.05 pm. Sharks Team 1. Ox Nche 2.
