President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday evening said he had
a phone call with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. He said the phone call dealt with the invasion of Ukraine
and the ongoing war. In a series of tweets on his official Twitter account, Ramaphosa
said South Africa has been asked to play a mediation role in ending the
conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “President Putin appreciated our balanced approach. We
believe this position enables both parties to subject the conflict to mediation
and negotiation. Based on our relations with the Russian Federation and as a
member of BRICS, South Africa has been approached to play a mediation role,” said
Ramaphosa. South Africa was approached to mediate due to its historical
ties to Russia and as a member of BRICS.
