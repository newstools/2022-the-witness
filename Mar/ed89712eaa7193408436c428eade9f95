Three family members of the Mzobe family in Ofafa, in the uBuhlebezwe Local Municipality near Ixopo, were
killed after they were struck by lightning on Wednesday afternoon. KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs,
Sipho Hlomuka, said the province continues to experience inclement weather
conditions that pose a danger to human life. Hlomuka said the reports received by the department indicate
that a 69-year-old woman and two children, aged 10 and 13, were killed
instantly when lightning struck their home in the afternoon. One other person was injured in the incident and rushed to
hospital for treatment. “We wish to express our sincere condolences to the family of
the victims. “We have assigned disaster management teams to provide the
necessary support to the affected family,” said Hlomuka. The MEC said the inclement weather conditions that were
experienced in parts of the province on Wednesday uprooted trees and damaged
both public and private infrastructure. He said disaster management teams continue to assess the
extent of the damage in the affected areas. “We continue to plead with our communities to exercise all
caution whenever a weather warning is issued by the South African Weather
Service. These warnings provide crucial information which can help to save
lives,” he said.
