The DA has called for the scrapping of mandatory vaccination policies at universities and other institutions of higher learning and training. On Wednesday, the party said while it strongly supports voluntary vaccinations, it do not believe in policies of mandatory vaccinations. DA shadow minister for higher education, Chantel King MP and Dr Ntombi Khumalo MP, who is a DA member of parliament’s portfolio committee for higher education, said the Department of Higher Education has yet to clarify the application of mandatory vaccination in institutions of higher learning. Yet, said King and Khumalo, many have adopted mandatory vaccination policies with limited scope for exceptions. They said this excludes multitudes of students who may wish to remain unvaccinated for various reasons. They said currently, students are only allowed exemption from vaccination for religious and medical reasons. This lack of clarity from the department and the universities, the DA MPs said, harsh mandates have already led to violent protests at the Durban University of Technology and other institutions of higher education in South Africa, resulting in millions of rands of infrastructure destruction. King and Khumalo have called on all public institutions of higher learning to adopt more inclusive alternatives to vaccinations as the current policies exclude students from education. They said the following alternatives will ensure safe learning spaces at institutions without excluding students from their studies: Negative Covid-19 test no older than 72 hours;A recent antibody test;A positive Covid-19 test that is older than 14 days but no older than some specified period, as natural immunity does wane. Rather than vilifying unvaccinated students and excluding them, the DA MPs said universities and training colleges should allocate resources for vaccine education, counselling and offering easy access. They warned that coercion will only further exacerbate distrust regarding the vaccines.
