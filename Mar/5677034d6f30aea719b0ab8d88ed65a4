A 19-year-old man has been arrested and charged with the murder of three-year-old Asemahle Ntshalintshali at Matiwaneskop near Ladysmith. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said according to the child’s relative, on March 10 Asemahle had eaten some snacks and went to sleep. The next day, the relative reported that the little girl started to vomit, and she died. Gwala said an inquest docket was opened at Elandslaagte SAPS. “At that stage, no foul play was suspected and there were no visible injuries on the deceased’s body. An intensive investigation and medical examination revealed that the child had internal blood clots in her head and kidneys. It was established that the child was severely assaulted and sustained internal injuries,” said Gwala. She said the inquest docket was then changed to murder. The investigation conducted by police led to the arrest of the 19-year-old relative who has been charged with murder. He will appear before the Ladysmith Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, March 22.
