Some Pietermaritzburg schools have been forced to suspend classes due to ongoing water outages in the Msunduzi Municipality. On Monday, the Maritzburg College issued a letter to parents saying they had been informed that the current lack of water in parts of Pietermaritzburg was likely to last until Least Thursday morning. The school said they had been informed that the problem, which left them without water since Monday, was at the Umgeni Reservoir. As a result of the water outage, the Maritzburg College decided to send home all the boarders who were able to leave and close for the next two days. “There will be no in person classes at Maritzburg College on Tuesday and Wednesday this week,” said the school in the letter. Meanwhile, Pietermaritzburg Girls' High School also sent out a letter to parents informing them that the school would be closed on Tuesday also due to water issues. The school said they currently had a reasonable supply of tank water in reserve which was hoped to see their borders through the outage. *This is a developing story.
