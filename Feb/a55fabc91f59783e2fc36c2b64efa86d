It is still unclear what might have led to the shooting of four family members in Imbali Unit 14 on Thursday night. The mother, father and two girls were attacked by unknown people in their home on Thursday night. A neighbour, who spoke to The Witness but asked not to be named, said she heard gunshots when she was watching soccer just before midnight. “I looked through the window to see what was happening but I saw nothing. I then received a call from another neighbour informing me that four family members have been shot dead. “This is scary because the people that were shot were very good people,” she said. The neighbour revealed that there were five family members in the house at the time but one managed to escape. "Police are yet to comment on the killings." *This is a developing story.
