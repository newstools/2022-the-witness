The owner of the Seemo Wholesalers in Richmond, KZN, was gunned down at his store during an armed robbery on Wednesday morning. According to community police forum member, Ricky Jugree, the incident happened around 7am, just after the store opened for business. He said eyewitnesses said the alleged assailants were driving a silver Toyota Hilux bakkie. Jugree said the previous owner of Seemo Wholesalers was also shot dead during an armed robbery a few years ago. “We don’t usually get a lot of business robberies in Richmond, and I suspect it’s people from other areas coming here to commit these crimes,” he said. The police are yet to comment on the matter.
