The Tatham Art Gallery has a new exhibition on display in the Schreiner Gallery called Material is Metaphor. It opens on Sunday next week, February 6, at 11 am and closes on March 20 at 2 pm. Entrance is free. This exhibition is by Rohini Amratlal, Bhekazi Ernest Ngcobo, Jess Bothma and Nindya Bucktowar. It focuses on how artists consider their materials — the “stuff” they craft and experiment with — to give a voice to a personal vision, said Reena Bhoodram, education officer of the gallery. “Visual metaphors are ‘primary’ images that the viewer understands as ideas. [These ideas] form connections to ‘secondary’ images that, depending on syntax, intensity, and frequency, act in concert to become a narrative. In this exhibition, the artists invite the viewer to experience material in novel ways by selecting, working, and presenting material in a particular context. “Materiality, history, societal structures, identity and more, all intersect to create an artwork. [It] is materiality that we will focus on in this exhibition — the ‘what’ so much more than the ‘how’ or the ‘when’,” she added. Bothma and Ngcobo, will conduct a three day workshop on February 23, 24 and 25 where they will unpack the concept of using materials as metaphor.
