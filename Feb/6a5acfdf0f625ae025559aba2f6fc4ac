Msunduzi residents celebrated their Valentine’s Day with laughter after an image of a heart shaped pothole filled with water went viral on social media, captioned ‘Happy Valentine’s Day from Msunduzi municipality’. Msunduzi residents are continuously facing problems with the water supply, electricity outages and potholes all over the city, however they at least had a little laugh amid all the trouble. Meanwhile, the Municipality took offence to the image and replied in a Facebook post saying that the image was not taken in Pietermaritzburg. “We would like to inform you that the below picture circulating on social media was not taken from Msunduzi, the municipality is working very hard to patch the potholes in and around the city,” read the post. The municipality continued to wish everyone a happy Valentine’s Day.
