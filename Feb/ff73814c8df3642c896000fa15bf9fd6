 The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has extended the online registration period to February 18. Initially, online registration was scheduled to end on February 11 and lectures were meant to start on Monday, February 14. DUT said the extension of registration will not affect the 2022 term dates and skeletal academic calendar. It said all six faculties will devise a catch-up plan for the week lost in lecture time, following the extension to the online registration period. DUT spokesperson Alan Khan said when lectures commence on February 21, the university will continue to offer multimodal, online teaching and learning to returning students. . Permits to access campus will be granted only to first year students and students who are enrolled for exit modules, to attend lectures on campus. "Other permits will be issued to students who require access to the practical laboratories and students whose conditions at home are not conducive for learning. All students who need to be on campus will only be permitted access, provided they meet the criteria of the Policy Choices on Vaccination of Staff and Students," Khan said.  With regards to health and safety measures, Khan said, the cleaning of residences will be completed before the arrival of students. "The use of face masks remains compulsory on all university property. "The HealthCheck online form will be used as a screening tool for Covid-19 and all students must complete their HealthCheck screening before arrival to campus."
