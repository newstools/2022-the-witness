The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has advised applicants to be careful of enrolment scams. According to a statement released by Executive Director Normah Zondo on Tuesday, the university has been made aware of scammers ‘registering’ prospective students for programs that do not exist. “The scammers are allegedly posing as administrators of two programmes that were discontinued a few years ago - the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Primary Health care programme (PHC) and the Bachelor of Nursing Advanced Practice Programme (BNAP),” said Zondo. Applicants have been alerted to disregard any information on these programmes and to only seek enrolment information from official university channels. She said all information on UKZN study programmes are available at www.ukzn.ac.za, and a chatbot is also available to assist. According to the university, the matter is being investigated.
