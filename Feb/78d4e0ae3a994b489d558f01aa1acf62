Police in the Umkhanyakude District, which shares a border with Mozambique, have a problem of cars being smuggled across state lines. This was according to KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala. Zikalala, along with members of the KZN Legislature are on a two-day (Tuesday and Wednesday) inspection programme monitoring police stations across the province. Speaking after his visit to the Jozini, Manguzi and Mabazwane police stations on Tuesday, Zikalala said the area was affected by car theft, particularly cars from South Africa being smuggled to Mozambique. “It's clear (there) is a collusion between criminals from Mozambique and some people in SA. It is operated as a syndicate form of an operation that needs serious attention,” said Zikalala. Zikalala said the KZN Legislature previously tried to address the matter by constructing barriers across the SA border. “But that programme was stopped because the portfolio committee of public works said it is not our mandate to do so and there was an investigation by the SIU (Special Investigative Unit),” he said. “What is amazing with this (is that) after they said so they have not taken the responsibility to complete the work we have started or something that will assist the people who are suffering with this matter.” Zikalala said he will raise the matter with the presidential coordinating council and consult the police and public works ministers for a coherent strategy to tackle this issue. Other interventions, he said, will be to expedite the opening of a nearly finished police station in the district and to mobilise the community to work with law enforcement. “We (must also) expedite the investigations because only they will tell us whether there are police involved in this thing or not... and ensure all those that are involved are arrested,” said Zikalala.
