The Durban University of Technology will be closing three of its campuses on Friday in anticipation of a planned student protest. In a statement released on Thursday morning, Alan Khan, DUT’s senior director of corporate affairs, said the Steve Biko, Ritson and ML Sultan campuses will be closed on Friday. “This is to ensure the safety and security of staff and students,” he said. “In the past such planned protest gatherings have turned violent, therefore the university wants to mitigate the risks attached to the protest action.” Khan said staff will be asked to work remotely and access to the three campuses will be prohibited to students. Khan added that the university’s security team will be on site to monitor the situation. Khan said the campuses will be open on Monday. Meanwhile, the DUT Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command are planning a march on Friday to commemorate the three year anniversary of Mlungisi Madonsela’s death. Madonsela (20) was shot and killed during a student protest at DUT in 2019. No one was prosecuted in relation to the matter due to a lack of evidence.
