A man is in a critical condition after he and four others were attacked by a swarm of bees in KwaDukuza, on the KZN North Coast on Tuesday afternoon. According to IPSS Medical Rescue’s Dylan Meyrick, five workers were cleaning a roof when they were attacked by the swarm. “All five workers have been severely stung, and two of them suffered allergic reactions. One was in a critical condition and was stabilised by IPSS Advanced Life Support paramedics before he was flown via helicopter to a specialised facility for further care. The second was taken to a local hospital. “Three of the workers luckily escape with minor reactions. They were treated on scene but did not require being transported to hospital.”
