Amazulu FC’s boss, Sandile Zungu, who was tipped to contest for the ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson position, has pulled out of the leadership race. In a statement released on Wednesday, Zungu said he took the decision not to contest the position following extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including the supporters of Amazulu FC. Zungu, who in 2020 made headlines when he bought the Durban-based Amazulu football club, also serves on the broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) presidential advisory council. The businessman spent several weeks pondering on whether to contest the ANC chairperson post following requests from individuals within the ruling party for him to do so. However, from the onset, there have been concerns that venturing into politics was likely to damage Zungu’s image as a successful businessman. “First and foremost, I thank the comrades who approached me to make myself available for leadership of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal as well as the exploratory committee that managed my consultation process. “I remain humbled by the support and confidence they demonstrated in me,” he said. The ANC in KZN which is currently led by Premier Sihle Zikalala, is scheduled to hold its provincial conference in June. Apart from Zikalala, treasury MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube is also tipped to enter the ANC provincial leadership race.
