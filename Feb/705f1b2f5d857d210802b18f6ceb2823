A man linked to the murder of a chief from KwaMpukane Royal house in the Ndlangubo area, Eshowe, was shot dead during a shoot-out with the police on Monday. Inkosi Hlanganani Cameron Biyela (54) was killed on November 13 last year as he arrived home. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said when Biyela was opening the door of his rondavel, he was accosted by four armed men who shot at him. She said it was suspected that one of the assailants was wounded because a trail of blood was seen leading from the crime scene towards the bush. Gwala said police officers from the K9 Unit were summoned to the scene to search for the gunmen but they had escaped. A case of murder was opened at the Eshowe SAPS. The docket was transferred to the Provincial Organised Crime Unit for investigation. On January 27, Gwala said, the investigation resulted in the arrest of two men aged 27 and 28 years old. They appeared in the Eshowe Magistrates Court. The matter was adjourned to February 7. On Monday, a team of detectives from various stations followed information that led them to a church in Matshana where the suspects were hiding. Police were met by a hail of bullets. A man believed to be in his thirties was shot dead during the gun fight. “A shotgun suspected to be used in the killing of the Inkosi was found next to the deceased suspect. Two other suspects aged 25 and 30 who were also at the same church were found in possession of two pistols with 16 rounds of ammunition in each firearm.” Gwala said the suspects are expected to appear in the Ngwelezane Magistrates Court soon on charges of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.
