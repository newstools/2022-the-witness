uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) Carl Niehaus, is of the view that Covid-19 restrictions were being used to silence dissenting voices. Carl, who on Friday appeared at the Estcourt Magistrate's Court, is facing charges for contravening Covid-19 regulations during his visit to Estcourt in July. During Friday's court proceedings, a video clip was shown in which Niehaus is seen addressing a group of supporters outside the Estcourt Prison shortly after former president Jacob Zuma's detention at the facility. When a reporter asked Carl whether he was not contravening the regulation, Niehaus said the regulations should not be used to “muzzle” free speech. At the time of his arrest, the country was under alert level 4 lockdown which prohibited gatherings. Earlier, Niehaus’s advocate, Nthabiseng Mokoena, told the court that the MKMVA spokesperson had gone to the prison to meet Zuma, who was serving a 15 month sentence for disobeying a Constitutional Court order to appear before the Zondo Commission. However, witnesses told the court that Niehaus had gone to the prison to launch the “Free Jacob Zuma” campaign. Police had given Niehaus an option to pay a fine but the MKMVA spokesperson opted to contest the charges in court. A staunch Zuma supporter, Niehaus is part of the radical economic transformation (RET) ANC faction opposed to President Cyril Ramaphosa.
