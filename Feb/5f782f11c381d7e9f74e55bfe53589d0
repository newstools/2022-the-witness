The body of a man was found floating in the Msunduzi River near the Sobantu bridge on Tuesday morning. It is alleged that the man was trying to cross the bridge at the weekend when he drowned. Sobantu residents who spoke to The Witness said people have been looking for him since Saturday. “We heard that he tried to cross the bridge on foot when it was full because of the rain and he was swept away by the water,” said a resident who asked not to be named. Community members managed to take his body out of the water to prevent it from being swept away any further. Police were at the scene.
