Midmar Mile organisers have assured swimmers who were stuck on the N3 traffic on Saturday, they will be allowed to swim whenever they arrive at Midmar Dam. A number of frustrated swimmers were stuck on the N3. The traffic was caused by a truck carrying flammable gas that overturned near Ashburton on Friday night. Emergency services were still recovering the tanker by Saturday morning and the road was closed. Traffic was diverted to the R103 but that too became congested. By 9 am, spokesperson for the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI), Zihle Mali confirmed the N3 northbound was opened for motorists travelling towards Pietermaritzburg. Race director, Wayne Riddin said swimmers shouldn’t panic because they understood the issues they were facing on the road. He added they were doing a rolling start and that those who missed their start time will be able to get into the water and will be timed from start to finish.He said they made provisions for all the swimmers. There was however a start up start time for the disabled race at 8 am but Riddin said those who were stuck in traffic can still swim and their finish time will be added into the results. Riddin said they've had a huge turnout from Saturday morning and some had finished their swimming, but they were still expecting more people. The world’s largest open water swimming event started on Thursday at Midmar Dam.
