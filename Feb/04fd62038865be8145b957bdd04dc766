Two men were arrested for allegedly shooting dead a 17-year-old boy on Butcher Road in Sydenham, Durban on Sunday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the teen, Jarrell Somana, was walking on Butcher Road when a vehicle approached him. She said three men got out the car and started shooting at him. She said Somana ran into a yard where he tried to hide under a bus that was parked there. The gunmen continued to shoot at him and he sustained multiple gunshot wounds and died instantly, she said. Mbele said police officers from the Sydenham Trio Task Team were alerted and swiftly responded. She said they chased the gunmen and were joined by a local security company. “The suspects were spotted as they drove through Forty Fifth Cutting Avenue. When the suspects reached a dead end, they opened fire on police officials before abandoning their vehicle. “Two suspects aged 26 and 27 were arrested while the third suspect managed to flee into the bushes.” Mbele said police seized two firearms and seven rounds of ammunition which will be sent for ballistic testing. Investigations by police revealed that the recovered vehicle was hijacked in Ntuzuma last month. The men are expected to appear before the Durban Magistrates Court on Tuesday on charges of murder, attempted murder, unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.
