Inanda and Umlazi police stations in KwaZulu-Natal are among the top three stations in the country which recorded the highest incidents of rape cases. This was revealed by Police Minister Bheki Cele on Friday during a presentation of the quarterly crime statistics, which reflected on crimes that occurred from October to the end of December. Cele said there was a 9% decrease in the number of sexual offence cases recorded. However, 11 315 people were raped between October and December in the country. He said this is a decrease of 903 rape cases, compared to the previous reporting period. In addition, all nine provinces recorded decreases in rape cases, said Cele. “Over 5 012 of the rape incidents took place at the home of the victim or the home of the rapist, 674 rapes were domestic violence related and 632 of the rape cases in this category, involved women victims and 42 were men,” said Cele. The Eastern Cape’s Lusikisiki Police Station and the Umlazi and Inanda stations recorded the highest incidents of rape. Cele said the decrease in some of the sexual offences, especially rape cases, can be attributed to all provinces increasing their Gender Based Violence (GBV) awareness campaigns. He said this includes contact meetings with SAPS and communities.
