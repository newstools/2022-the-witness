KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza has blamed low morals for the killing of four family members in Imbali Unit 14, in Pietermaritzburg. Khoza visited the family on Thursday with Umgungundlovu District Mayor Mzi Zuma and ward 41 councillor Mabhungu Mkhize. Pastor Bheki Hlela, his wife Ntombifuthi Hlela and two children Simwinile Nzimande (24) and Siphokazi Hlela (15) were attacked at their home on Thursday last week. It is alleged that the killers kicked the door open to get into the house. Pastor Hlela and his wife were found lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen and the girls were found in their bedroom. One was found on the floor and the other was found in bed. On Friday, another family member committed suicide. Describing it as a disaster, Khoza said what happened to the family was hard to believe. “We are at a time where our community has low morals. The killing of one person is shocking, but four people is something that you cannot accept. We will not rest until the killers are arrested and punished accordingly. We do not want to see them roaming around the streets,” she said. Khoza said they also want the mastermind behind the family murder arrested. “It is good to find the killers, but it better when you find the person who is behind everything, because killers are bought,” said Khoza. She said they believe someone from the community sourced the killers and that drugs also influence incidents like this. “The source of this is drugs because no one in his or her sober senses can do something like this,” said Khoza. She said they will be assisting the family with counselling and other needs. The family members will be laid to rest tomorrow.
