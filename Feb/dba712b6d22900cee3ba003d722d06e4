Former National Correctional Services head, Arthur Fraser,
who illegally released former President Jacob Zuma from prison, is embroiled in
a fresh controversy. Fraser, who left the department late last year after his
contract expired, was this week found to have unlawfully placed KwaZulu-Natal
Correctional Services regional commissioner, Mnikelwa Nxele, on suspension. Since his appointment as the department’s national
commissioner in 2018, Fraser placed Nxele on suspension multiple times. However, General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council
(GPSSBC) arbitrator Katlholo Wabile, found that Nxele’s latest suspension was
unfair. Wabile, who ruled that Nxele should have simply been given a
written warning for his failure to declare a property, dismissed the 13 charges
Fraser had brought against the department’s Correctional Services regional
head. Nxele, Wabile ordered, should report to work on Monday. In September, Fraser released Zuma who was serving a
15-month sentence for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before the
Zondo Commission, on medical parole However, the Gauteng High Court has since ruled that
Fraser’s decision to release Zuma on medical parole was illegal. The department, which on numerous occasions claimed that
Nxele’s suspension was legal as the KZN regional commission was facing serious
charges, declined to comment on Wabile’s findings. “The matter remains internal as it pertains to the employer
and employee,” the department’s spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo said. Nxele welcomed Wabile’s ruling.
