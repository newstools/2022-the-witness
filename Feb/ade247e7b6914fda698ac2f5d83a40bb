A line of dead fish and a foul stench along Winklespruit Beach in Durban has been reported by residents. Tamlyne Hartwanger, an Amanzimtoti resident, said she was taking her daily beach walk with her family on Monday morning when they noticed the foul stench permeating from a small river near the beach. “Today was really different. We don’t normally smell something like that, it is usually fresh air, this time it was a really bad smell. It was like a mix of sewage and a chemical smell that got stuck in my nose,” she said. As they got closer to the beach, Hartwanger said they were greeted by the sight of dead fish collecting on the shores of the beach. Hartwanger said there were at least more that 50 dead fish which ranged in size from tiny to about 15 centimetres. Hartwanger said from the smell, they suspect that the cause of the incident is either a sewage or a chemical leak. “We know this keeps happening and happening along our little river beds here and hopefully this (the pictures) get to the right authorities and sorted out quickly because it cannot keep on happening like this. This sewage or chemical spill or whatever it is happening can’t keep on (killing) our ecosystem like this,” she said. Andre Beetge, ward councillor, said the eThekwini Municipality had been notified of the dead fish and they were sending people to collect them. The eThekwini Municipality is yet to comment.
