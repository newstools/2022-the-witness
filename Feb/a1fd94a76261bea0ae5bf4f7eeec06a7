About 11 pupils from various Pietermaritzburg schools were taken to hospital on Tuesday morning after the vehicles they were travelling in collided with each other on Dr Chota Motala Road. Three men, two drivers and a conductor were also among those injured. Mi7 Emergency Medical Services manager, Brandon Drinkwater, said the minibus taxi and bakkie were both transporting pupils to different schools in the City when the collision took place. Due to the impact of the accident, some of the pupils in the bakkie were ejected from it. The school children sustained minor to moderate injuries. The oldest child taken to the hospital was 12-year-old, said Drinkwater. The other pupils are aged between six and 10 years old. Drinkwater added that some of the pupils refused to be assessed by paramedics and said they were fine.
