“There is hope for a new dawn after all,” said Deena Padayachee (70) after being helped by the Hayfields community. The pensioner said that he was blessed to see the community of Hayfields come together to help him when his car stopped suddenly in Blackburrow Road while he was on his way to the Hayfields Pick n Pay. “I don’t know what happened to my car, it just stopped in the middle of the road, and I didn’t know what to do, but then, about five people in total stopped and tried to help me,” said Padayachee. He said one man even went to the nearest petrol station to get him some petrol at his own cost, and a doctor from DuziMed also went back a few times to check if he was fine while he was waiting for assistance. According to Padayachee, he was stuck on the road from about 4.30 pm and only got home after 7 pm. “This incident showed me that there is hope after all for the Hayfields community, especially after the July unrest. There is hope for renewal and it’s lovely to see the positivity of this community,” said Padayachee. He thanked everyone who helped him that evening. “I also wish that this hope for renewal will spread to other communities in Pietermaritzburg, like Imbali, and more,” said Padayachee.
