The ANC’s provincial office in Durban was vandalised after a man threw a brick through its glass doors. Nhlakanipho Ntombela, ANC provincial spokesperson, said the incident happened on Sunday afternoon. “Only the doors are vandalised. The security guards apprehended the man shortly after he threw the brick and he was arrested by police,” said Ntombela. Ntombela said the motivation of the incident is unknown at this stage and they are waiting for a police report. In a separate incident on Sunday, Ntombela announced that the official ANC KwaZulu-Natal Facebook page had been hacked. Ntombela said the hackers gained access to the page’s security settings and removed all admin members. Ntombela said he understands the hackers are trying to get the page, with over 73 000 followers, taken down. “We condemn this unscrupulous act of cyber-bullying in the strongest possible terms,” he said. “Our political opponents are clearly threatened by the popularity of the page, which had become the ANC KZN’s trusted voice and authority on information. The ANC has been a target of a plethora of attacks over time, and, in hindsight, it was a matter of time before our enemies and enemies of progressive forces resorted to this kind of sabotage.” The page is still up. On Sunday night, the page went live for over seven hours, playing only an animated video of the Brawl Stars logo, a popular online shooting video game. Ntombela said their technicians were working to regain the control of the page.
