Former president Jacob Zuma, who is due back at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday morning, will not be present at court. The JG Zuma Foundation announced on Twitter on Tuesday that Zuma will not be attending in the Pietermaritzburg Court on Wednesday. “Judgment will be noted by members of President Zuma's legal team,” said the foundation. In his application, Zuma wants the lead prosecutor in his arms deal criminal case, advocate Billy Downer, to be removed. Zuma, who says NPA officials have violated his rights since the beginning of his arms deal criminal case in 2005, wants to be acquitted should the court find that prosecutors treated him unfairly. Several roads will be closed around the High Court in Pietermaritzburg ahead of Zuma’s court case. Msunduzi Municipality said road closures in the Pietermaritzburg CBD will start at 6 am to minimise traffic disruptions. Only minibus taxis and the metered taxis will be allowed to go through the Church and Boshoff streets intersection, including those wanting to access services at A.S. Chetty Building and also other businesses in the area. There is a speed fence across Church Street and Old Market Street. To avoid Old Market Street, motorists should either turn left into Otto Street or go up Church Street towards the City Hall. Vehicles moving up Church Street from the lower CBD area will be diverted either to the right at Boshoff Street through to join Pietermaritz Street or turn left into Boshoff Street to join Jabu Ndlovu in order to get to upper CBD areas. Traffic officers will be available to assist with the flow of traffic and safety of motorists.
