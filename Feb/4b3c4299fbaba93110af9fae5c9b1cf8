The high temperatures and humidity have got the Mozambique spitting cobras moving around in Durban. Unfortunately, they have been found by dogs who learnt the hard way that these snakes can defend themselves. Nick Evans, a snake rescuer,  had multiple calls over the weekend, to either remove a cobra or to give advice regarding a cobra that spat in a dog’s eyes. Mozambique spitting cobras are considered to be one of the most dangerous snakes in Africa. In a report released by Evans, he advised that should one see a cobra, "just move away from it slowly" and to be vigilant during these hot weather conditions, as snakes also come out to seek shade and to cool off. “If you’re more than four metres away (preferably a bit more to be extra safe), you’ll be fine,” said Evans. “These snakes have been cruising around looking for food, which is mostly toads, although other snakes could be on the menu too, and rats,” he added.
