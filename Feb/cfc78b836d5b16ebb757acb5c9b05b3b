Despite reports that the missing pet anaconda, Medusa, was found last week in Phoenix, it turns out she was only found on Sunday. The almost two metre yellow anaconda escaped a temporary enclosure in Starwood, Phoenix, on Thursday, January 27 while her home was being maintained. On Monday last week, owner Preesen Nair told The Witness that the snake had been found. He said he would not be speaking any further about the snake and did not provide details on how, when, where or in what condition the snake was found. However, it emerged this week that Medusa was actually found on Sunday. This after a woman posted on social media about the snake in her relative’s yard on Sunday. According to media reports, Nair confirmed on Monday that the snake was found on Sunday in a neighbour’s yard and was in his possession. Nair told TimesLIVE that he did not lie to the media about the snake being found. He said that he was told the snake was found and that was the information he shared. He told TimesLIVE that he did not say that he found the snake.
