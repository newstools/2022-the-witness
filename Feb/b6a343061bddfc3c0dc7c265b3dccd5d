 The IFP has lost power in Nongoma, in northern KZN, after the NFP won a critical ward in Wednesday's by-elections. The IFP, which before the by-elections was in control of the municipality through a coalition with the EFF, lost a ward to the NFP. This resulted in the IFP/EFF coalition remaining with 22 of the Nongoma Municipality’s 45 council seats. Nongoma was an IFP stronghold until the November municipal polls when the party failed to secure an outright majority. Currently led by IFP Mayor, Albert Mncwango, the Nongoma Municipality is also home to the disputed Zulu King, Misuzulu kaZwelithini.
