The trial of Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association
(MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, is set to continue at the Estcourt
Magistrate Court on Friday. The MKMVA spokesperson is facing charges for contravening
Covid-19 regulations. According to the state, Niehaus broke the regulations when
he addressed a crowd outside the Estcourt Prison in July shortly after the
arrest of former president Jacob Zuma. On Thursday witnesses testified that despite being warned, Niehaus
went ahead and addressed a crowd of about 50 people who were gathered outside
the prison. At the time, the country was under Alert Level 4 Covid-19
lockdown. However, Niehaus's lawyer, Advocate Nthabiseng Mokoena, told
the court that the MKMVA spokesperson had gone to the prison to meet Zuma, who
was serving a 15-month sentence for disobeying a Constitutional Court order to
appear before the Zondo Commission. Upon arrival at the prison, Mokoena said, Niehaus was
approached by a group of people, including journalists, who started asking him
questions about Zuma's arrest. Police had given Niehaus an option to pay a fine, but the
MKMVA spokesperson opted to contest the charges in court. A staunch Zuma supporter, Niehaus is part of the radical
economic transformation (RET) ANC faction opposed to President Cyril Ramaphosa. The trial was set to close on Friday.
