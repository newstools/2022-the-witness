Suspended ANC MP Mervyn Dirks, says he is fully behind MKMVA spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, who appeared in the Estcourt Magistrate's Court on Monday for violating Covid- 19 regulations. Dirk was suspended by the ANC leadership last month after the Pietermaritzburg-based MP lodged a complaint against President Cyril Ramaphosa with the Select Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). According to Dirks, Ramaphosa was aware of the use of state funds for ANC internal campaigns but failed to report the corruption to the police.
