Former ANC eThekwini Municipality councillor for Clermont, Bheki Mvubu, was shot and killed outside his home on Thursday night. Brigadier Jay Naicker, provincial police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to The Witness and said the case will be passed on to the National Political Violence Task Team for investigation. “It is alleged that yesterday [Thursday] at 18:45, a 50-year-old man was shot and killed while he was alighting from his vehicle outside his home in Wyebank,” said Naicker. “The victim was shot by three unknown suspects who fled the scene. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds. A case of murder has been opened.” Mvubu served as eThekwini Ward 19 councillor from 2016 to 2021. He was replaced by the ANC's Sikhanyiso Hlongwa in last year's municipal elections.
