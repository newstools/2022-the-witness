A 28-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly lying that she was raped by two men in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said the woman alleged that on the evening of February 11 this year, she was asleep in a house at B Section in Osizweni when she heard someone opening the door. “She alleged that a known suspect carrying a knife entered and accused her of not paying rent. She accused the man and his brother of raping her.” Gwala said charges of rape were opened at Osizweni SAPS. The docket was transferred to Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. “The two brothers aged 34 and 36 were arrested. Following an intensive investigation that was conducted by the investigating officer, it was established that the complainant lied under oath. The two brothers were then released.” Gwala said a case of perjury was opened for investigation at Osizweni SAPS and the woman was charged for perjury. She appeared in the Madadeni Magistrates Court on Monday and was remanded in custody pending the next court date. “We once again appeal to our citizens to refrain from reporting false cases as valuable police resources are wasted chasing untrue allegations thus depriving genuine victims of crimes from realising justice,” said Gwala.
