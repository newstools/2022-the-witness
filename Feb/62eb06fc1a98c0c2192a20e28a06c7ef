A seven-year-old pupil from Sydenham Primary School, Durban has been left in a serious condition after being hit by a car on Monday morning. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911 Spokesperson, said the girl was not crossing at a pedestrian crossing when the accident happened. "While (she) was running across the road, (she) was struck down by a car. The car then pulled off on the side of the road," said Herbst. "The child was in extreme pain to hip and pelvic region. She was treated on scene by advanced life support paramedic and transported to hospital." Herbst said the mother of the pupil was alerted and arrived on the scene. Herbst said the pupil's condition was "serious but stable."
