While the past few days has been scorching in Durban and the Midlands with maximum temperatures reaching up to 35 degrees- the hot days are coming to an end. It is expected to be cooler on Friday, 20 degrees in Pietermaritzburg and 24 degrees in Durban. According to the South African Weather Service (Saws), this weekend will be a lot cooler as showers are expected. Wisani Maluleke, a weather forecaster, said, “Tonight, we can expect a 30% chance of rain and from tomorrow there is a 80% chance of rain in both Durban and the Midlands areas. We can expect a 60% chance of rain on Saturday and Sunday,” said Maluleke. He explained that extremely high temperatures usually indicate that a cold front is coming, which is why there will be heavy rains this weekend. The weather office has also issued out a weather warning of isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms expected in KZN on Thursday evening. Saws said some of the thunderstorms are expected to be severe in the west and southern KZN. Heavy downpours leading to flooding and strong damaging winds are some of the impacts associated with the thunderstorms. According to the warning, areas expected to be affected include Alfred Duma- Indaka, Alfred Duma- Ladysmith, Dannhauser, Dr N. Dlamini-Zuma- Underberg, Endumeni, Greater Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Inkosi Langalibalele- Estcourt, Inkosi Langalibalele- Sobabili, Mpofana- Giants Castle, Mpofana- Mooi River, Newcastle, Okhahlamba, Richmond, Msunduzi, Ubuhlebezwe, Umgeni, UMuziwabantu and Umzimkhulu. While concerns of cyclone Batsirai, which is approaching the east of Madagascar, have erupted, Maluleke said this weekend’s rainfall has nothing to do with Cyclone Batsirai. He added the service will continue to monitor Batsirai and alert the public should it come to KZN.
