Former president Jacob Zuma is back at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday morning for judgment on his application for leave to appeal. In his application, Zuma wants the lead prosecutor in his arms deal criminal case, advocate Billy Downer, to be removed. Zuma, who says NPA officials have violated his rights since the beginning of his arms deal criminal case in 2005, wants to be acquitted should the court find that prosecutors treated him unfairly. Given Downer’s track record in the criminal matter, Zuma said it is unlikely that he would receive a fair trial should the matter be allowed to proceed. However, the state said that Zuma’s claim is speculative. In his appearance two weeks ago, only a handful of his supporters were in court to lend him support. Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus, who is a prominent Zuma supporter, said the former president’s support network is not expecting large crowds outside court during Wednesday’s proceedings. “It should be remembered that President Jacob Zuma’s trial hasn’t begun. It’s only if the trial starts that we will see large crowds,” Niehaus said.
