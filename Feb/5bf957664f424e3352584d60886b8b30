Beware the baby snakes - they’re also dangerous. That’s the warning from Durban’s snake rescuer Nick Evans who said it’s hatching season and reflected on the hatchlings he has caught over the past weekend. “I’ve been having a few clutches of eggs of late, from the gravid females I caught earlier in the season,” says Evans. Some of the hatchlings he caught this past weekend include nine green mambas, and a Mozambique spitting cobra. “Baby mambas, black and green, are very, very rarely seen, so it’s so nice to see a whole bunch, and even better to watch them slither off into their new homes,” said Evans. Another hatchling that Evans found was a Mozambique spitting cobra, which he found outside a kitchen door in Queensburgh. According to Evans, the snake was tiny and it seemed to be a few days old. Evans continued to warn people about the importance of being careful around hatchlings like the Mozambique spitting cobra. “The snake is still venomous, so it should definitely be treated with caution, as they can still spit (although nothing like an adult), and bite,” said Evans.
