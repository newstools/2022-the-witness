The Sharks’ new Argentinian flyhalf, Tito Bonilla, has been selected to start against the Stormers in the United Rugby Championship (URC) on Saturday. The teams will be meeting for a second consecutive URC clash, at Cape Town Stadium where kick-off is set for 5.05pm. Sharks coach Sean Everitt announced his team on Thursday, with Bonilla switching places with young flyhalf Boeta Chamberlain, who moves to the bench. At scrumhalf, Jaden Hendrikse will start the match ahead of Grant Williams, who will play off the bench. Former Wallaby star Ben Tapuai wasn’t considered for selection due to injury and his place at No.12 goes to Lukhanyo Am, while Jeremy Ward takes the No.13 jersey. Tapuai’s injury has allowed Werner Kok to come in as a replacement for the trip to Cape Town. The two teams met in Durban last Saturday and it ended in a 22-22 draw despite the Sharks’ dominance of the proceedings. Everitt couldn’t hide his disappointment after that clash and will be hoping that his men can do better in Cape Town this weekend.
