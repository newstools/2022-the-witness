Residents from Jika Joe Informal Settlement in Pietermaritzburg have again on Monday morning blockaded a number of roads, including the N3. It is believed that protesting residents blocked Manning Avenue with burning tyres and trees. They also blocked Manor and the N3 northbound before the Dr Chota Motala off-ramp, bringing traffic to a standstill. The N3, however, has since been open. According to one of the residents, who asked not to be named, residents are still angry and are demanding housing from the municipality. He told The Witness that residents don’t want to be moved and have their houses built elsewhere, they want RDP houses built for them in Jika Joe. “We are still fighting the same issue and our demands are still the same. The municipality wants to build houses for us far away from this area and we are against that. We told them last week that we will not fall for their promises and will get what we want even with force. They still want to [build us] temporary housing structures, yet we made it clear to them that we are against them,” he said. Manning Avenue is still blocked and law enforcement agencies are also on the scene. *A developing story.
