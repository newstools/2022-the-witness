A 55-year-old man was admitted to hospital after his aircraft crashed in Merrivale in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Tuesday morning. Roland Robertson of the Midlands EMS said paramedics found the plane that had crashed into a maize field with the pilot lying next to the wreckage. "The man was spraying crops using an aircraft and must have lost control of it and crashed in Birnamwood, Merrivale. He had moderate injuries," Robertson. It is alleged the man crashed into a gum tree with the left wing. He was rushed to a nearby hospital.
