Three people were arrested on Tuesday after Phoenix police conducted an intelligence operation at a well-known drug den at Wareham Place in Westham. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said three people were arrested after they were found in possession of drugs. They are aged between 18 and 46 and were found in possession of 650 capsules of heroin. Mbele said police then went to Charclay Gardens in Clayfield where a 31-year-old man was found in possession of 20 tablets of mandrax and five pieces of cocaine. All four suspects are expected to appear before the Verulam Magistrates Court on Wednesday for possession of drugs.
