Team MyLife paddlers dominated the 2022 Dusi Canoe Marathon’s opening day on Thursday as Thulani Mbanjwa and Msawenkosi Mtolo won the men’s stage, while Bianca Haw and Abby Solms ruled the women’s category on the day. The three-day Dusi race started at Pietermaritzburg’s Camps Drift on Thursday morning and will finish at Blue Lagoon in Durban on Saturday, with K2 as the official competition format this year. Over 770 paddlers started the river marathon in Pietermaritzburg and were greeted by cool weather and a decent number of spectators as they began their journey to Durban. Title favourites Andy Birkett and David Evans enjoyed an early lead until Mbanjwa and Mtolo overtook them during the first portage at Campbell’s Farm. Mbanjwa, the first black K2 winner in 2008, and his current partner Mtolo never looked back as they reached Mission Rapids with a lead of almost a minute ahead of the defending champion Birkett and young Evans. Mbanjwa and Mtolo reached the finish line at Dusi Bridge in the Valley of a Thousand Hills in a time of 2hr 39min 48sec, with Birkett and Evans in second place in 2:40:21. Nqobile Makhanya and Sibonelo Khwela rounded off the podium in a time of 2:42:29. In the women’s section, Haw and Solms will start Day Two with a solid lead after they finished in 3:05:52 on Thursday, ahead of Jordan Peek and Christie Mackenzie who completed the stage in 3:13:58. Bridgitte Hartley and Pippa McGregor took third spot for the opening stage in 3:21:18. Friday’s Stage 2 starts at 6 am in the Valley of a Thousand Hills and ends at Inanda Dam.
