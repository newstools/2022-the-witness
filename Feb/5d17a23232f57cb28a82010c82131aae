Traffic was temporarily backed up on the N3 after a large
tree fell onto the road on Friday afternoon. According to Dawud Phungula, a motorist stuck in the
traffic, the tree is located about two kilometres before the Mariannhill Toll
Plaza, Durban bound. Phungula said the tree slid down from the forest above the
road and caused a truck and small vehicle to crash into each other. He said the drivers were not injured but their vehicles
suffered minor damages. “It looks like there were people who were cutting the trees
above and somehow this fell on to the road. They have since run away from the
scene now," he said. By 1:30 pm, Phungula said a group of motorists had been able
to slightly move the large tree to make space for cars to pass through one by
one.
