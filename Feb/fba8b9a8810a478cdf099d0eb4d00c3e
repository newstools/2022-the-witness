Over 30 pupils from Richards Bay High School, northern KwaZulu-Natal, were rushed to hospital, following a suspected gas leak on Monday morning. Some pupils were also treated at the school. It is alleged there was an ammonia cloud that passed over the school from a nearby factory. Pupils who were in the school yard were mostly affected. Ward 3 councillor, Henning de Wet, who lives close to the school, said he was also affected. “About 30 minutes after I smelt the gas, I received a call from the school and rushed there,” said de Wet. “You could smell it from the house and then your throat will be sore, you also get headaches.” He added the Richards Bay Clean Air Association, uMhlathuze Air Quality Unit and other authorities were investigating. Residents who were also affected were encouraged to send their complaints to complaints@rbcaa.co.za. Spokesperson for the Department of Education, Kwazi Mthethwa, said the district director is currently at the school to gather more information. “Affected learners have been sent to the nearest hospital for treatment,” said Mthethwa.
