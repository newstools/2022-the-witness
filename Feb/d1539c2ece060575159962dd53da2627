For a second time this week, residents from the Jika Joe
Informal Settlement in Pietermaritzburg have blocked numerous roads in the city. On Thursday morning, residents blocked Manning Avenue, Masukwana
Street, Prince Alfred and Burger streets outside the settlement with burning
tyres and trees. Residents also broke bottles on the road and threatened
passing motorists. Residents told The Witness that they are demanding proper
housing structures from Msunduzi Municipality. They say they are against the temporary housing structures
that are currently being constructed by the municipality and demand that low-cost
houses be built for them in Jika Joe. “At the end of the day, they will hear us and as promised,
we will keep protesting until they eventually hear our demands. The
municipality is disrespecting us and want to do as they please. We will keep
protesting until the KZN Human Settlement MEC (Jomo Sibiya) comes and addresses
us,” said one of the protest leaders. Police and other law enforcement agencies were on the
ground. *This is a developing story.
