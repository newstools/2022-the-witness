times in a drive-by shooting on the M7 near the N2 bridge in KwaZulu-Natal on

believed to be around 40 years old, was seated in his tow truck when an unknown
number of gunmen sprayed his vehicle with a high calibre firearm in a drive-by
shooting. The man suffered gunshot wounds to his abdomen and lower
limbs and was rushed to a nearby hospital. The SAPS were in attendance and will be conducting the
necessary investigation accordingly.
