The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of widespread scattered showers and thundershowers expected in the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday. The weather office said development of thunderstorms, supported by abundance of moisture, pushed into the province may results heavy downpours especially in the extreme south west. “There is a possibility of the thunderstorms to become severe therefore strong damaging winds and hail are still possible.” Areas that could be affected include Dr Nkosazane Dlamini-Zuma Municipality, Underberg, Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Inkosi Langalibalele Municipality, Estcourt, Sobabili, Mkhambathini, Mpofana, Giants Castle, Mooi River, Okhahlamba Municipality, Ray Nkonyeni Municipality, Richmond, Pietermaritzburg as well as Ubuhlebezwe, Umdoni, uMngeni, UMuziwabantu, Umzimkhulu and Umzumbe municipalities. Residents are urged to avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above their ankles, and to take caution when traveling on roads as potholes may be filled with water and there may be sinkholes.
