Members of the KwaNyavu tribe have taken to the streets yet again demanding that their chief be reinstated. On Friday morning, the members marched to the Pietermaritzburg High Court to support their former chief, Sikhosipho Mdluli, who was stripped of his chieftaincy in December 2020 by the KwaZulu-Natal premier. The Mdluli family filed a case in court against Premier Sihle Zikalala. Earlier this year, 11 schools were disrupted from opening as the community members locked the school gates demanding that Chief Mdluli be reinstated.
