School safety challenges require societal engagement, with the public playing a proactive role in creating a conducive environment at schools. This emerged at a webinar on school safety held on Thursday. Chief director for media engagement at the Government Communication and Information System, William Baloyi, called for broader societal engagement on issues of crime affecting schools in the country. Baloyi said the recent violent incidents that happened in schools prompted government to devise plans on creating a conducive environment at schools. In a recent incident, robbers stormed into Dassenhoek High School, Pinetown, and robbed and stabbed four pupils. It’s alleged that the robbers were armed with guns and knives. In another incident, a deputy principal of Phomolong Secondary School in Gauteng, was shot dead outside the school on January 21. Head of Equal Education (EE), Ntsikie Dlulani, said a recent survey conducted in the Western Cape schools revealed that 40% of pupils had experienced violent incidents at their schools. “There should be interventions that respond to immediate safety threats as well as more long-term, proactive and preventative measures must be developed.” EE called for more deliberate coordination between relevant government departments to respond to school safety challenges. Dlulani said there must be adequate physical security infrastructure to maintain and improve access control at schools and capacitation of the psycho-social support services to improve pupils’ access. There should be regular training and support of school-based safety structures such as safety committees,” Dlulani said. Lieutenant Colonel Tsekiso Mofokeng said police in Gauteng signed an agreement (MOU) with the Department of Education in 2011 to ensure the safety of pupils at school.
