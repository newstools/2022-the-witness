Six people from a business forum were arrested after trying to hijack the multi-million rand construction of the Durban High Court. The court is currently undergoing a massive R850 million renovation project that is scheduled to be completed in 2025. According to a statement issued by the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI), a group of “heavily-armed” men forced their way into the construction site on Tuesday morning. “(They) stopped workers and chased away contractors appointed by the DPWI in an attempt to gain control of the construction site,” reads the statement. Imtiaz Fazel, Acting Director-General of the Department, then issued an instruction for police to be called for assistance and for charges to be laid. Police arrived on the scene and arrested six people, reads the statement. Fazel commended the police for their swift action in resolving the situation. “It is such disruptions that have led to delays in many projects, disrupting service delivery and holding the country to ransom,” he said. “We would like to reiterate that as a Department we will prosecute, to the fullest extent of the law, anyone who seeks to illegally benefit from state infrastructure projects.” The project includes renovating the historic building and constructing new buildings to accommodate additional courtrooms and staff. The High Court has been temporarily been moved to the Durban Magistrate’s Court since December 7 last year. Construction at the site is expected to resume on Monday.
