Two men are due in court early next week in connection with the murder of a man at Impendle in KwaZulu-Natal, as well as robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Police said in a statement that a multidisciplinary team consisting of various units within the SAPS acted on information about a vehicle that was stationary near a hall at France in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. "When the team was approaching the France area, they spotted the same vehicle with two occupants who were also sought for murder and robbery that was committed in Impendle. The vehicle was searched and police found a pistol with 30 rounds of ammunition. Two suspects aged 30 and 40 were placed under arrest." Police said that on February 3, the body of a 67-year-old man was found on the roadside near a farm in Impendle with gunshot wounds to the head. "The investigation conducted by detectives revealed that the deceased was taken from his workshop which is situated at Willow in Impendle by the two men in a vehicle. His tool box, bank card and other items were missing. The recovered firearm will be subjected to ballistic testing." The men's car was impounded for further investigation. Police identified the dead man as Gandela Melko Dlamini, saying those arrested will also be profiled to check if they are linked to other murder cases and crimes committed in the area. "Both men are expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court on charges of murder, robbery as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition."
