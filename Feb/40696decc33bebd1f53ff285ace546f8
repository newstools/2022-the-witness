An under 16 football team from a Pietermaritzburg School left on Tuesday to compete in the FIFA-CAF PAN African schools football championship tournament in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The team, from Edendale Technical High School, won the National Schools Sport Championship in the Free State recently, which qualified them for the DRC tournament. The MEC of arts, culture, sports and recreation Hlengiwe Mavimbela, along with education MEC Kwazi Mshengu wished the team well during a send-off on Tuesday. Mavimbela said in a statement that the trip is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the girls because the Confederation of African football (CAF) and FIFA have identified South Africa to participate in a pilot inter-school football tournament where the team will be joined by five other African countries. “The tournament is part of FIFA’s 2020-2023 vision ‘to make football truly global’ and to fulfil its primary mission of making football accessible to all,” said Mavimbela. She said sports and education can never be separated as they play a complimentary role in the development of young people. The MEC added that it is important to encourage children to participate in school sports because it helps in identifying talent from an early age and exposes pupils to opportunities like these. Meanwhile, Mshengu wished the team well on their trip. “The fact that you qualified for the tournament, means you are already winners,” said Mshengu. He also added that them participating in sports means that they will be spared of social ills. Ntombifuthi Khumalo, coach of the girls’ team thanked both MECs for the support as they head to the DRC. “We are grateful for the opportunity, and we are confident that we will make our province and South Africa proud,” said Khumalo. The team will return on February 21.
