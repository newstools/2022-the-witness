Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, appeared at the Estcourt Magistrate Court on Monday. A staunch supporter of former president Jacob Zuma, Niehaus is facing criminal charges for violating Covid-19 regulations. According to the National Prosecuting (NPA) Niehaus contravened Covid-19 regulations when he organised a protest outside the Estcourt Prison during Zuma's incarceration in July. During his arrest, police gave Niehaus the option to pay a fine, but he opted to contest the charges. A group of supporters, including ANC suspended MP, Mervyn Dirkes and radical economic transformation (RET) chairperson, Nkosentsha Shezi, accompanied Niehaus to court.
