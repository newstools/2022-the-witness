The Pietermaritzburg High Court has sentenced Nkanyiso Nzama to 25 years imprisonment for the murders and attempted murders he committed in Kranskop in 2019. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in KZN, said Nzama was also convicted of the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. She said Constable Thandoluhle Mhlongo and his friend Mazwi Zuke were in the Kranskop area when they were shot at by Nzama and others. A shootout between the two groups ensued, and Mhlongo died at the scene while Zuke died in hospital. Two of Nzama’s co-conspirators were also killed in the shootout while he was arrested a week later. In court, Ramkisson-Kara said senior state advocate Sipho Magwaza led cellphone and vehicle tracking evidence to link Nzama to the crime. Magwaza led the evidence of witnesses who the court found to be credible. “While the state argued for life imprisonment, based on the fact that the murder was planned and premeditated, the court after hearing arguments on a sentence, from both the state and the defence found Nzama’s age to be a significant and compelling circumstance to deviate from the minimum sentence of life imprisonment,” she said. Nzama was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment each for the murders of Mhlongo and Zuke, 15 years imprisonment each for the murders of his two co-conspirators, seven years imprisonment for each of the three counts of attempted murder, and 12 years imprisonment for the unlawful possession of firearm and ammunition. The court ordered that the sentences run concurrently, resulting in the effective sentence of 25 years imprisonment. Further, Nzama was declared unfit to possess a firearm. Ramkisson-Kara said the NPA welcomes this successful prosecution and hopes this sentence will send out a strong warning to all perpetrators that they will face the law no matter how long it takes.
