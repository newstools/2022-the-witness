Multiple Dusi Canoe Marathon champion Andy Birkett and his young partner Dave Evans took control of the 2022 race by being clear winners of the second stage at Inanda Dam on Friday. The former Maritzburg College old boys overtook overnight leaders Thulani Mbanjwa and Msawenkosi Mtolo early in the 46km stage and did not look back until the finish at Msinsi Resort on Inanda Dam outside Hillcrest. Birkett and Evans hold a strong overall lead of three minutes and 16 seconds going into the final day of racing on Saturday to the finish point at Blue Lagoon in Durban. Ngobile Mkhanya and Sbonelo Khwela sit third in the overall standings, but are a hefty 14 minutes behind the leading pair. The women’s race on Friday featured a second consecutive stage win for Abby Solms and Bianca Haw, ahead of main rivals Christie Mackenzie and Jordan Peek. Solms and Haw hold a lead of almost seven minutes. All four women have tasted either K1 or K2 success in the Dusi in recent years and are not likely to slow down in the final stage. A distant third in the women’s standings are Bridgitte Hartley and Pippa McGregor after they had a tough second stage. The mixed category is led by Murray Starr and Candice Murray from Anna Notten and Lance Kime. Saturday’s final stage is a 36km paddle from Inanda Dam to Blue Lagoon in Durban, starting with 4km of flatwater on Inanda Dam and ending with 10km of flatwater on the tidal estuary into the finish. This is the 71st edition of the Dusi Canoe Marathon and features more than 750 entrants, with K2 as the official competition format this year.
