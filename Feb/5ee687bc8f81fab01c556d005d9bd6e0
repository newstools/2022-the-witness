South Coast snake catcher Sarel van der Merwe was recently
bitten by a green mamba during a call out in Munster on the KZN South Coast. Van der Merwe said he got bitten just after his headlamp
died and he could not see properly because the call out was during the night. “The green mamba was in a semi-open roof and because I could
not crawl in the roof, I had to cut the ceiling board. As the mamba got out, I
grabbed it with my grab stick and as I was bagging it, my headlamp died on me
which is when I got bitten,” said van der Merwe. He said he eventually managed to finish bagging the snake
and asked the house owner to call someone who will drive him to the Port
Shepstone Regional Hospital. The snake catcher said he is never doing night call outs
again because after being bitten, he felt like that was his last call out. He added that he was given anti-venom in hospital before
being discharged. Before van der Merwe was bitten, he had a call out in
Mvutshini on the KZN South Coast for a black mamba which was curled high up on
a mango tree.
