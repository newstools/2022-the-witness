With police suicide cases on the rise, the Independent Policing Union of South Africa (Ipusa) has called on all SAPS management to intervene and address the situation to help curb suicides in the service. The organization has implied, in a statement, that police suicides are the product of SAPS management’s failure to proactively deal with members mental health problems. According to Ipusa, the Employee Health and Wellness program (EHW) is battling the fight against police members' mental health problems. President of the organization Bethuel Nkuna said in the statement that professions that help people, like the police, also have their own personal issues which lead to their mental health being affected. “Police officers find themselves working long and abnormal working hours not compensated for and if they receive their compensation, [it comes] very late. Some of them are compensated with day offs, which is contrary to the working agreement. These unplanned activities contribute immensely to family relationships breakdown, said Nkuna. Ipusa has urged all members of the service, their family members and colleagues to speak out if they are in need of assistance. She urged police who were struggling to get help. “Families must also heed this clarion call, should they see that their family members who are police personnel are struggling mental health issues. Colleagues must also assist because usually, they are the first to know if their colleagues have mental health problems,” read the statement. Ipusa has also called for commanders to support their members in times like this.
