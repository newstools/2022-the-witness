A mother was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for the murder of her son in the Pietermaritzburg high court on Monday. Acting Judge Rose Mogwera sentenced Ziningi Jane Nzama (49) to 20 years’ imprisonment after she pleaded guilty to the murder of her son Asanda Kwanda Nzama (20). In court the state was represented by advocate Mbongeni Mthembu, and the woman by advocate Amanda Hulley. According to the plea agreement, the Inchanga mother and son had a turbulent relationship after the death of Nzama’s husband. It was said that Asanda was emotionally, verbally and financially abusing his mother. “The abuse began after the accused’s husband died in January 2020,” said the plea agreement. It stated that Asanda began taking drugs and would take the family vehicles without permission. “He would damage the vehicles and expect the accused to pay for them. He would shout at her on a daily basis and disrespect her,” the agreement said. In February 2021, Nzama entered into a relationship with Mthokoziseni Majozi. “She informed him that she needed his help to kill [Asanda]. He agreed to help her,” said the agreement. The two took out a funeral policy for Asanda, bringing a third person, Simphiwe Silangwe, into their plan. On April 14, last year, Nzama was contacted telephonically by Majozi. “He told her to go check on [Asanda] as he was shot at night,” the agreement said. Nzama went to Asanda’s room as she did not hear the gunshots. She found him dead, with gunshot wounds. She was arrested a few months later, and immediately confessed. “She co-operated with the police leading to further arrests,” it said. Silangwe (29) and Majozi (49) were also arrested for charges of pre-mediated murder and fraud. Their matter was adjourned to February 24. They are still in custody.
