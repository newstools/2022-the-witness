Condolences have poured in for Durban’s most famous street vendor, Mthokozisi ‘Mr PS’ Mbili, who was shot and killed allegedly during a robbery. According to Colonel Thembeka Mbele, Provincial Police Spokesperson, Mbili (42) was killed by an unknown gunman on Denis Hurley Street, in the Durban CBD on Thursday last week. Mbele said circumstances around his shooting are still being investigated by police. The news of Mbili’s death has shocked many Durban residents and people across the country. Mbili was famous for selling sweets around Durban central and shouting “PS” in reference to the Cadbury chocolate brand. Mbili was recognised by the chocolate brand and was given a huge gift basket. Simphiwe and Wele Vilakazi, Durban comedians, wrote on their Facebook page; “The news of PS is very painful. He hustled up until the very end. The city of Durban is hurting.” Glenaire restaurant which is situated in the Durban city centre said Mbili had become a member of their family over the years. “Your big smile, infectious laugh and humble nature has made a remarkable impact on each and every person who has ever had the privilege of knowing you,” reads their Facebook post. Singer and entertainer, Sqengqe Shibase wrote on his page that “The world will never be the same without you, Mr PS.” Lindani Hlongwane, a business consultant, recalled his time attending conferences with Mbili. “The thing I will miss the most though is trying to track you after I heard you say Pssssss, then disappear into the crowd, then hear you again, and keep following your voice down and around Smith and west street,” he said. Efforts are underway on social media to track down his family in Umlazi.
