The Durban University of Technology (DUT) had to close three of its campuses on Tuesday after four vehicles, allegedly belonging to staff members, were torched. According to Alan Khan, DUT’s senior director of corporate affairs, a group of students from a political organisation (which he did not name) forced entry into the Steve Biko campus on Tuesday morning. Once inside the campus, Khan said the group divided itself into two. “The DUT protection services personnel tried to apprehend the group, however, the two groups were already in the basement of the S10 building and the S10 basement parking area. Four unidentified vehicles, allegedly belonging to DUT members of staff, were set alight by the protesters who invaded the campus,” he said. Khan said private security along with other law enforcement helped extinguish the fire. Shortly after the incident, the university closed the Steve Biko, Ritson and ML Sultan campuses for the safety of staff and students, Khan said. He said: He said the university will not be accepting walk-ins or in-person registrations on their campuses. On Monday, thousands of prospective students descended on the university following a fake message that the university was allowing in-person registrations. The university housed many of the prospective applicants at its campus student residences. A member of the DUT Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command, who did not want to be named said they did not have anything to do with the torching of the cars. “All we are interested in is making sure that students are given an opportunity to register. Many people here came from faraway places and it is not fair that the university is not even giving them an opportunity to register,” they said. The campuses are set to reopen on Wednesday.
