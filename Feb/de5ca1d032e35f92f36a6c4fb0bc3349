Eight gunmen who were arrested for allegedly murdering two taxi drivers during a taxi war in Newcastle have been remanded in custody. On Thursday last week, a group of people were at Itheku Taxi Rank in Madadeni, in Newcastle, when a group of unknown people opened fire at them. According to the police, the group of men allegedly shot and killed Njabulo Shezi (34) and Charles Hadebe (39). Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala said two additional taxi drivers were injured and were taken to hospital for medical attention. Gwala said the gunmen fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. She said Madadeni police were alerted to the shooting, and swiftly responded to the scene. “The suspects were traced to Newcastle, where they were hiding in a rented house. With the assistance of the Newcastle Public Order Police, eight suspects aged between 29 and 39 were placed under arrest,” she said. During the arrest, it was discovered that the gunmen were security guards, said Gwala. She said four AK47 rifles, four pistols and 90 rounds of ammunition were seized from the arrested men. Gwala said a vehicle was also seized by police for further investigation. “The suspects appeared in the Madadeni Magistrate’s Court yesterday on charges of murder and attempted murder. They were remanded in custody until February 7,” she said.
