The national correctional services department on Sunday confirmed that it has once again placed KwaZulu-Natal regional commissioner, Mnikelwa Nxele, on suspension. Last week General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council (GPSSBC) arbitrator Katlholo Wabile, dismissed the misconduct charges against Nxele -who has been on suspension for several years. Wabile also ordered that Nxele's suspension be lifted. However, the correctional services department on Sunday said it has resolved to lodge an application to have Wabile’s ruling set aside. “The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) reaffirms the continued suspension of the KwaZulu-Natal Regional Commissioner, Mr Mnikelwa Nxele. “This decision has already been communicated to Mr Nxele and his legal representative. This action is unavoidable as {the department} is reviewing the award unjustly granted by the GPSSBC on 7 February 2022,” the department’s national spokesperson, Sibangakho Nxumalo, said.
