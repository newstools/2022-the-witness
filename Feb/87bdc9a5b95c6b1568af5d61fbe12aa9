President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to deliver his annual state of the nation address today. In the wake of a weak economy and high unemployment rate, The Witness took to the streets to find out what the public is expecting from him. Nondumiso Madondo said, “We want to know why we don’t get the R350 unemployment grant.” Thamsanqa Mofokeng and Lunga Dlamini said, “We just want people to be able to get jobs and to do away with this lockdown. Unemployment is the reason some people turn to crime, so he must give us jobs.” Lindani Duma said, “What I’m expecting from the Sona and the president of the country is for him to tell us the progress in terms of employment since he promised to deal with that issue last year. We also want to hear what the president has to say in terms of funding for students, since NSFAS is now a loan scheme. Duma said: “What is the outcome or what is going to happen now that the inquiry is over, is there any action that will be taken against the guilty or was it just done to tick a box. “The president must be clear in terms of the unemployment grant of R350. Are we going to be able to maintain it and how?” Michelle Stephens and Gin Barnard said, “We want him to do away with masks, we want to be free to choose whether we want to wear masks or not.”
