Eskom on Wednesday morning announced that it will be implement Stage 2 load shedding from 11 am to 5 am on Monday. The power utility said this load shedding is necessary due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns of two more generating units during the night. Eskom said a unit each at Kusile and Kendal power stations tripped. It said delays in returning units at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Lethabo and Grootvlei have contributed to supply constraints. Total breakdowns amount to 14 994MW while planned maintenance is 4 435MW of capacity as Eskom continues with reliability maintenance. The power utility said three generating units are expected to return to service by Wednesday afternoon. Eskom is appealing to citizens to reduce their use of electricity and switch off any non-essential items.
