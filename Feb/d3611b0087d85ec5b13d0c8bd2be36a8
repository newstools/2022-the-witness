After not being able to host the Royal Show for the past two years, the organisers say all plans are on track for this year’s show. The director of the Royal Agricultural Showgrounds, Terry Strachan, said the event will take place over 10 days, from May 27 to June 5. Strachan said close to 70% exhibition space has already been sold, and this has been accompanied by significant interest from the agricultural community. “The Royal has been chosen to host three prestigious national livestock championships; being the Hampshire Down and Ile De France sheep breeds, and for the first time, the Chianina cattle breed (An exceptionally large animal of Italian lineage).” A full entertainment programme is promised, this included Prime Circle, Wonderboom, Cantrel, Kickstands, Shut Up Its Sunday, Elvis Blue, Demi Lee, Pietman Geldenhuys and the Coffee Snobs. And as it has become tradition, there will also be a music and dance extravaganza overseen by Hindvani FM, as well as a performance of the full KZN Philharmonic Orchestra.
