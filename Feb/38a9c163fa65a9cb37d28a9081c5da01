Some of the KZN North Coast beaches, that were closed after shark safety gear was removed last week, were reopened on Monday. The KwaDukuza Municipality said the KZN Sharks Board started redeploying their nets on Monday, following the precautionary closure on Thursday. The beaches were closed last week after the KZN Sharks Board removed shark safety gear in anticipation of rough weather. “Whilst the beaches are now open, bathing or swimming is only allowed at beaches where shark safety gear has been restored,” KwaDukuza spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said on Monday. As of Monday the gear had been restored at Thompson Bay in Ballito and Salt Rock beaches. “This will progress to other beaches over this week owing to favourable weather conditions. “The municipality appreciates the high level of co-operation [from the public] in adhering to the municipality’s precautionary decision,” he said.
