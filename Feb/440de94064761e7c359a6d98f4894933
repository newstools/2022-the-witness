Plumes of flames and black smoke from a burning truck
created a scary scene on the N3 just after Lynfield Park south bound on
Saturday morning. A flammable liquid carrier caught fire on its way towards
Durban. Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) spokesperson Zinhle Mali said
no other vehicle was affected by the fire and no injuries were reported. “The truck had offloaded flammable liquid and was on its way
from Johannesburg towards Durban. Even though the truck was no longer carrying
the load, it had not been washed off the remnants so that could be the reason
why the flames were huge. Traffic is monitored and the flames are under
control,” said Mngomezulu. She said traffic had earlier backed up as both lanes were
closed because of the fire. “Once it was extinguished, at least one lane was opened, and
the traffic started flowing again, even though at a slow pace. Once the road is
cleared of the truck, traffic flow will return to normal," she said. She said according to the driver, the horse (head of the
truck) just caught fire and the cause was mechanical fault, and not the
contents that were carried by the tanker earlier.
