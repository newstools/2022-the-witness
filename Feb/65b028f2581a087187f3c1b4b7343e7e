A document, alleged to be a leaked intelligence report from the South African Police Service, has been doing the rounds on social media. The document alleges that there is a planned looting of Massmart stores in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend. Makro, Game, Builders Warehouse, Rhino and Cambridge are just some of the stores that fall under Massmart. Brian Leroni, Massmart's senior vice president of corporate affairs said they were aware of this document and reached out to law enforcement to verify its authenticity. “The rumour currently remains unverified and we anticipate that our stores will trade as normal over the weekend,” he said. “We have however implemented numerous additional precautionary measures.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele, provincial police spokesperson, released a statement saying, "The SAPS treats all threats as serious and accordingly will deploy police officers and necessary resources to curb such threat." “Unfortunately, we cannot comment on internal communication between departments in SAPS and other security forces and we once again request members of the public to refrain from posting such documents as such could compromise operations of security forces,” she said.
