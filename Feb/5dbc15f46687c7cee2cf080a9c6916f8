The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday dismissed former president Jacob Zuma’s application for leave to appeal last year’s ruling that went against him in his arms deal criminal case. The court dismissed an application by Zuma to have lead prosecutor, advocate Billy Downer, SC, removed. Handing down judgment, Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Piet Koen, said Zuma's application lacked any “prospects of success”. Zuma, Koen said, should allow his trial to proceed and appeal at the end of the trial if he wished. Despite Zuma not being present at court on Wednesday, there was heavy police presence on site. Only a handful of Zuma supporters were seen outside court.
