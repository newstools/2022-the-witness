Pupils from Woodlands Secondary School in Pietermaritzburg have been warned not to take part in the TikTok #UmlandoChallenge. A video of pupils from Woodlands Secondary School dancing to an Amapiano song by TOSS, 9umba, Mdoovar called Umlando has been making its rounds on social media since Friday. The video shows a group of boys dancing to the challenge in the school yard. Other pupils are seen following them around the yard, dancing in excitement in a chaotic way. The school also doesn’t allow cell phones but pupils were able to smuggle them into the school and took videos during the challenge. This disrupted schooling. Many schools in the country have been seen taking part in this challenge. It requires pupils to carry anything but a school bag to school and dance to the song. Some go as far as using home appliances like microwaves for their school books. Boys at times wear women’s outfits. The school principal, Andrew Moodley, said the challenge lasted not more than five minutes at the school premises. “We heard pupils were planning to do the challenge again on Monday, and we urged parents to not allow their children to participate and that no one would be allowed to the school without a school bag,” Moodley said. He added the two boys who were seen dancing in the video were warned. Their parents were also called to the school. Moodley said security and the Mountain Rise SAPS were informed about the possibilities of the challenge happening again on Monday.
