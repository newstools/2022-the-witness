The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has dispelled rumours of an outbreak of a fever caused by contaminated water in South Africa. The NICD’s spokesperson, Sinenhlanhla Jimoh, said there have been numerous social media posts with false information about enteric fever in South Africa that are attracting widespread attention and causing needless concern and panic at the moment. “These posts allege either that there are currently cases of enteric fever in certain towns or provinces caused by contaminated municipal water, or that the bacteria causing enteric fever have been identified in certain municipal water sources,” said Jimoh. She said these statements are factually incorrect. “There is no evidence that recent cases of enteric fever are linked to contaminated municipal water in any part of the country, and there is no evidence that the bacteria causing enteric fever have recently been identified in municipal water sources anywhere in the country. “This includes those districts in Western Cape and North West provinces in which the clusters (small localised outbreaks) have been identified,” she said. Jimoh said people can protect themselves from enteric fever and many other infections by washing their hands regularly, following the World Health Organization’s food safety practices, and using safe and clean water.
