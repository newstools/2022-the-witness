Lost files and test results as well as patients waiting in long queues are some of the problems being faced at Northdale Hospital. This was seen first-hand by members of the health portfolio committee in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature during a surprise oversight visit at Northdale Hospital on Thursday. Patients told committee members about the issues they were facing. Some said they were told their medical test results were lost.

The committee visited all the wards and hospital departments to check how they were functioning. *This is a developing story.
