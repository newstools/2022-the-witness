A KZN snake catcher is appealing to people not to kill snakes. Snake rescuer and conservationist, Nick Evans, said the best option is to call a snake catcher for help. He said often people assume all snakes are dangerous any try to kill them which could be dangerous for both the person and the snake. He said, “Lately the ever common spotted bush snakes have been very active in this hot weather, and I’ve had a number of calls for them.” He said most of the calls have been for the snakes found indoors. “[Probably] trying to find a cool spot from the heat outside.” He said the spotted bush snake is by far the most common snake in the greater Durban area and in many parts of coastal KZN. “They are completely harmless, non-venomous, and only a threat to your house geckos.” Describing their appearance, Evans said they are thin, green snakes with a yellow belly. “No more than a metre in length, with black spots going half-way down the body.” Differentiating between the other common green snakes found in KZN, he said the coastal-dwelling green mamba is plain green. “Specimens under a metre are rarely seen. “Boomslang only start turning green when they are around a metre long, and by then, they’re much thicker than a bush snake.” Boomslang can also be identified by the short stubby snout and large eyes. He said spotted bush snakes can be shoo’d away with a broom, or simply left alone. “However, if someone is unsure they should call a professional for help.”
