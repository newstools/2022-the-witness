Medicross has paid tribute to well-known Pietermaritzburg doctor, Ivana Nosenzo who practised there for close on 20 years. Nosenzo died recently. Salome Liebenberg, general manager of operations at Netcare Medicross, said that family and loved ones of Nosenzo, her colleagues and patients alike have been deeply impacted by her untimely death. She said Nosenzo will always be remembered with deep affection by all who knew and worked with her. Liebenberg said: Liebenberg said in a statement that Nosenzo completed her undergraduate MBChB degree at the University of the Witwatersrand and thereafter worked as a registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology for four years. She later opted to change specialities to general practice and completed her training in the United Kingdom where she worked for several years. On her return to South Africa she practised as a general practitioner in various practices in KwaZulu-Natal until settling at Hayfields Medicross where she built up a highly successful practice. In a special tribute from her colleagues she was described as an exceptional general practitioner who went beyond the call of duty for her patients, often to the detriment of herself. “A good doctor and an excellent listener who was known to be compassionate, dedicated and loyal, Dr Ivana had a considerable impact on all of us and most importantly on her patients. She had a wide knowledge of medicine with an extensive library and references and her advice was often sought by her colleagues. “She was respected and loved by patients, staff and colleagues and had a strong sense of justice as well as being supportive of women’s rights in the workplace.”
