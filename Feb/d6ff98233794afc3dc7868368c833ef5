The Sharks will show just two changes to their line-up from the last match when they face Benetton in the United Rugby Championship in Italy on Saturday. Coach Sean Everitt on Thursday named his team for the outing at Stadio Comunale di Monigo in Treviso and it features Curwin Bosch back in the flyhalf position. Argentina international Tito Bonilla drops to the bench as a result. In the other change to the run-on team, Ruben van Heerden comes in for Hyron Andrews due to concussion at lock, while Le Roux Roets joins the bench. Scrumhalf Cameron Wright is also on the bench because of a suspension affecting Grant Williams. Everitt’s side from Durban are coming off a morale-boosting 29-22 victory over the Bulls in Pretoria a fortnight ago, while Benetton went down 13-3 to Glasgow Warriors in Scotland last weekend. Those outcomes left both the Sharks and Benetton in the middle of the 16-team standings. Everitt’s Springbok-laden team left last Sunday for Treviso in north-eastern Italy. Saturday’s game is scheduled to kick off at 5.05 pm. Sharks team: 15 Aphelele Fassi, 14 Sbu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am (capt), 12 Marius Louw, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Curwin Bosch, 9 Jaden Hendrikse, 8 Phepsi Buthelezi, 7 Henco Venter, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Gerbrandt Grobler, 4 Ruben van Heerden, 3 Thomas du Toit, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Ox Nche.
