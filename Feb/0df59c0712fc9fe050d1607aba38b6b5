Mountain Rise Police have opened an inquest docket after passers-by saw a man’s body floating in the Msunduzi River near the Sobantu Bridge on Tuesday morning. It is alleged that the man was trying to cross the bridge at the weekend when he drowned. Colonel Kholeka Mhlongo confirmed the incident. She said there were no injuries on the body to suggest the man may have been killed. Sobantu residents who spoke to The Witness said the man had allegedly disappeared on Saturday after he tried to cross the bridge that was overflowing because of heavy rains. “His body was taken out of the river by the residents who wanted to prevent it from being swept away any further. People know that after heavy rains no one uses that bridge because it is dangerous. We are glad that his body was found,” said a resident who did not want to be named. The bodies of a mother and baby boy who were swept away while crossing a river on the KZN North Coast were found on Monday night. Paul Herbst of Medi Response said a fisherman who was netting in the river around 7.30 pm on Monday night found the bodies. “The baby was still tied to the mom’s back. He notified local authorities. Durban SAPS divers and the K9 unit responded to the call and retrieved the bodies of the baby and the mom,” Herbst said. KZN SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, confirmed the bodies were recovered by the SAPS search and rescue unit on Monday night. The Kwa-Dukuza SAPS have opened an inquest docket.
