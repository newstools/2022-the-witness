The trial of Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, kicked off in the Estcourt Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Niehaus is facing criminal charges for breaching Covid-19 regulations. A staunch former president Jacob Zuma supporter, Niehaus has been accused of organising a protest outside the Estcourt Prison shortly after the former president was incarcerated at the facility in July. Zuma, who was later released on medical parole, was sent to the prison for disobeying a Constitutional Court order to appear before the Zondo Commission investigating corruption and state capture.
