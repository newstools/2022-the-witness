The South African Local Government Association (SALGA) in KZN has no leadership structure in place. This, after the association failed to convene its elective conference in January, with insiders claiming that the ruling ANC was trying to hijack the process. On Monday, the situation was chaotic at the Olive Convention Center in Durban when the processes failed to get underway with delegates having to leave the venue after spending the entire day trying to get the processes going. In the middle of the chaos, DA representative Janis Holmes, lost her council issued laptop which she had put on the chair. “The conference did not sit the entire day. ANC councillors, I believe they just registered and then they disappeared. My laptop was on the chair and I had moved away from it for a bit and it was gone. With all the security around and cameras in place, yet I lost a laptop. I opened a case with the Durban Central police. One would not expect this to happen in a venue where public figures converge. This is disturbing,” said Holmes. SALGA spokesperson, Sivuyile Mbambato, said the KZN conference was held on January 13 and 14. He said the conference resolved to adjourn and reconvene within 21 days. “The position being contested is the SALGA chairperson, three deputy chairpersons and six ordinary members of the provincial executive committee. Each municipality is represented by the mayor, speaker and the municipal manager and each municipality is entitled to cast one vote,” he said. ANC provincial spokesperson Nhlakanopho Ntombela said the allegations that the ANC had tried to hijack the SALGA elective conference were nonsensical. “How do we hijack SALGA processes where each municipality is entitled to only one vote? If you have five municipalities then you have five votes so calculate the municipalities that are in the province,” said Ntombela.
