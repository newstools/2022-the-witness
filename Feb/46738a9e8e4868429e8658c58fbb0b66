Media24 is selling the bulk of its media operations in KwaZulu-Natal to
Capital Newspapers for an undisclosed amount, the publisher announced on
Monday. The transaction includes The Witness, Weekend Witness and two community
newspapers, Echo and the Greytown Gazette. Media24 acquired a 50% share in the then Natal Witness Printing and
Publishing company in 2000 and bought the remaining shares in 2010. Ishmet Davidson, CEO of Media24 said: “This transaction is part of the
consolidation process we embarked on three years ago to reshape Media24 in a
landscape that is increasingly digital.” “It
has been a great privilege to have had The Witness, the oldest
continuously published newspaper in South Africa, in our portfolio,” said
Davidson. “We are very proud of the team’s continued commitment to fearlessly
holding the powers that be to account and contributing to independent
journalism in the region over the past 175 years. Likewise, the four community
newspapers, that are deeply rooted in and trusted by the communities they
serve.” The
transaction is expected to be concluded and the business transferred to Capital
Newspapers by July 1, including the vast majority of staff members currently
employed within the operations. Davidson
wished them and the titles only the best for the future in their new home.
“Thank you also to our loyal readers and advertisers for their support – it was
an honour to be part of our readers’ lives and to promote local business for
more than two decades.”
