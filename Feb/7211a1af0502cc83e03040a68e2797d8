An accused rapist who was released from police custody due to ill health is on the run after failing to appear for his scheduled court case in Durban. Senzo Landlord Mbeje (35) is being sought by the Brighton Beach Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, Durban. According to Colonel Thembeka Mbele, KZN provincial police spokesperson, Mbeje was arrested in connection with an alleged 2014 rape of a 27-year-old woman at Cato Crest, in Mayville. “It is alleged that on 6 September 2014 at 04:15, the victim was on her way home when she came across three armed suspects,” said Mbele. “At knife point they demanded money and cellphones. When she told them she had nothing, the suspects became irritated and threatened to harm her. One suspect pushed her down on the road and raped her, while the other two were keeping a look-out.” Mbeje did not appear for his scheduled court date on January 28 at Durban Magistrate's Court and a warrant of arrest was issued for him. “We appeal to anyone with information regarding his whereabouts to contact the investigating officer detective Constable Bouvrie on 081 046 3162/ 081 418 1264 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Mbele.
