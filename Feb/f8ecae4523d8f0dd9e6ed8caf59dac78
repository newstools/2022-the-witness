The Sharks have made three changes to the team that will start against the Bulls in the United Rugby Championship (URC) in Pretoria on Saturday. Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Thursday also named flyhalf Curwin Bosch and loose forward Sikhumbuzo Notshe on the bench for the game, which will start at 5.05 pm. The Durban-based franchise are desperate to get their URC campaign back on the road after a disappointing draw and defeat in their previous two outings against the Stormers. There are two changes in the forwards, as lock Gerbrandt Grobler is set to start in the second row ahead of fellow lock Ruben van Heerden, who is among the replacements. Experienced flank Henco Venter has replaced Jeandre Labuschagne at openside flank. The final change in the backline sees Marius Louw back in the team and taking over the inside centre duties, while skipper Lukhanyo Am is shifted back to outside centre. Jeremy Ward, who wore the No.13 jersey and formed a centre pairing with Am last week, has been dropped from the matchday 23. Bosch makes a return after he fell out of favour due to low confidence and a hip injury, while Notshe was also out with a terrible knee injury. The two stars were given a chance to prepare for their return to the URC by representing the Sharks in the Currie Cup last week, where they performed well.
