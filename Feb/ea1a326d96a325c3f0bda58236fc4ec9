Hayfields residents, in Pietermaritzburg, have been urged to remain vigilant following a recent spike in vehicle theft. “We have received recent reports of an increase in vehicle theft, specifically bakkies, with Ford Rangers being targeted,” said Charnel Hattingh, head of marketing and communications at Fidelity ADT said on Tuesday. Hattingh said residents are urged to park in a secure area, preferably a garage that can be locked, and to consider installing additional outdoor perimeter security, such as beams. “Remain vigilant and do not leave anything to chance. If you see anything suspicious in or around your neighbourhood, report it immediately to your private security company and local SAPS,” said Hattingh.
