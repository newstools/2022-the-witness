“You don’t want to get on the plane under pressure to qualify, so tomorrow (Saturday) will help a long way in seeing how far we can end up on the log.” These were the words spoken by Sharks coach Sean Everitt ahead of Saturday’s crunch United Rugby Championship encounter with Connacht at Hollywoodbets Kings Park. A bonus-point win for the hosts should see them remain in fourth place and go into their final round robin clash in Belfast against Ulster in pole position to host a quarter-final. The Sharks have won seven of their last eight games in the competition and head into this one off the back of a 28-23 defeat of leaders Leinster. With the business end of the tournament well and truly underway, the Durbanites are embracing the pressure after their tough introduction. Everitt said: “Initially we had to build up our performances to where they are now, so there has been a lot of focus in the group. With the senior guys there in the Springboks, they’re used to the pressure situations so that’s helped us.” Considering the congested nature of the URC log, a loss for any team in the top eight could spell the end of their hopes of hosting in the knockouts. Everitt, though, is backing his men to keep improving. “I feel things are coming together really nicely now. I think what let us down last week was probably our alertness on the field and obviously in tight games you can’t afford to give away soft opportunities. He added: “But going into this game against Connacht, they’re a massive threat on the floor, so obviously we’re focused on that again this week so that we can improve by the time we get to Ulster.” The match gets underway at 4.05 pm.
