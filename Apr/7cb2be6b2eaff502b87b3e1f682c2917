A 36-year-old woman employed as a supervisor for the eThekwini Municipality was gunned down on Old Main Road outside the Water and Sanitation premises in Durban on Saturday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said they received a call from a passer-by after two men were seen fleeing the scene in a red Seat Ibiza. The reaction officers and medics arrived on scene just after 3 pm. Rusa’s spokesperson, Prem Balram, said the woman was found lying on the ground next to a water tanker. “She was shot multiple times in the head, face and body. She showed no signs of life and was declared deceased by medics. Ten spent 9mm cartridges were recovered near her body,” said Balram. According to her colleagues, the woman was in charge of trucks used to distribute water to areas experiencing disruptions. She had just returned from Tongaat when she was gunned down. Balram said the motive for the murder is yet to be established. eThekwini mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, has called on law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned and arrest the gunmen who killed the employee. “We are in the grip of a disaster and this murder is something we do not need. We condemned it and we hope the police will move with speed and arrest those responsible. “This employee was entrusted with the critical responsibility of controlling our water tankers. We urge anyone who may have information regarding this unfortunate incident, to work with the police. We send our heartfelt condolences to her family and colleagues,” said Kaunda.
