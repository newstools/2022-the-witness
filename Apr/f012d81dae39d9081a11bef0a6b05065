Season two of The Real Housewives of Durban wraps up with a two-part reunion on May 6 and 8 and it will be hosted by Comics Choice’ nominee Donovan Goliath. The well-known comedian, presenter, MC, facilitator, and actor said that he was excited to host the reunion and to meet the housewives. “I’ve always been intrigued by this concept and this show. “I was excited to host the reunion because I really wanted to meet the wives and get to know more about this world from them,” said Goliath. Let It Rain Films executive producer Sam Kelly said that Goliath was the perfect host for the two-part reunion. “He came with the right amount of humour, the right amount of compassion, and the right amount of love for all the ladies and the storylines on The Real Housewives of Durban,” said Kelly. Season two came guns blazing with riveting drama, from Nonkanyiso Chonco, better known as LaConco’s mystery man, altercations between Jojo and Mabusi, to Makhumalo being called out for distancing herself from the group. This reunion has viewers waiting anxiously to see the highly anticipated drama that is about to unfold. Season two of The Real Housewives of Durban’s reunion will be aired on Showmax.
