Twitter has been buzzing after a video of a man sitting in a shopping trolley holding onto the back of a fuel tanker on the freeway was shared on the social media platform. In the video, taken by people in vehicles behind the tanker, the man is seen sitting in a trolley holding onto a fuel tanker that is moving at a high speed in the rain on the N1 in Gauteng. Seeing that he’s being recorded, the man smiles and waves at those taking the video. A woman taking one of the videos is heard saying, “Dude has a death wish”. It is not clear if the truck driver is aware of the hitchhiker or not. Gauteng traffic police spokesperson, Sello Maremane, said the incident happened on Sunday. Speaking on eNCA, Maremane said investigations into the incident are currently underway and the hitchhiker will be brought to book soon. “The Gauteng traffic police would like to warn hitchhikers that such irresponsible behaviour is punishable by law enforcement authorities. “He has not just placed his own life in danger but is also endangering the lives of other motorists,” said Maremane. He went on to say that if motorists witness such incidents, they should try and alert the truck drivers, as in most incidents the driver is not aware of the hitchhiker, and also alert law enforcement.
