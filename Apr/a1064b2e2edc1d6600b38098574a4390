ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) president, Bathabile Dlamini, is scheduled to meet the ANC top six leadership structure on Monday to chart the way forward over her conviction on perjury charges. The meeting between Dlamini and the ANC top six structure which includes President Cyril Ramaphosa takes place amid calls that she should be removed from her top position considering her conviction. While Dlamini and her supporters insist that she should be allowed to continue in her role as both ANCWL president and member of the ANC national executive committee (NEC), the ruling party’s step aside policy stipulates that ANC members charged or found guilty in a criminal court should step down. Last week the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court sentenced Dlamini, who is the former social development minister, to four years’ imprisonment with the option of a fine after she had lied under oath during a 2017 inquiry into the social grants debacle at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). The debacle left millions of social grant beneficiaries uncertain if they would receive their money.
