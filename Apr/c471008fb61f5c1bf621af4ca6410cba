Former Junior Springbok flyhalf Lubabalo Dobela will make his HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series debut in Singapore next weekend after being named in the Blitzboks squad for the fifth tournament of the 2022 season. The former Toyota Cheetahs player, who turns 24 years old next month, is the only newcomer in the squad named by coach Neil Powell — who made three changes to the side that were triumphant in Seville at the end of January. Dobela will replace Justin Geduld, who picked up a knee injury in that tournament, while regular captain Siviwe Soyizwapi is also back leading the squad after missing the last tournament due to an injury suffered in Malaga the previous week. Ronald Brown — the recently named 2021 SA Rugby Sevens Player of the Year — who also missed the Spanish leg due to injury, makes a welcome return to action as well, replacing Branco du Preez, who is recovering from a shoulder injury. “It is great to have Ronald and Siviwe back again, while I am pleased that Lubabalo is getting his opportunity,” said Powell. Powell added: “The squad has been working hard in recent weeks and for good reason. We have done well in the series so far, but that counts for nothing and the players are well aware of that.” Dobela was elated when Powell told him that he will make his Blitzboks debut. “That was a great feeling, especially since I lost a family member recently, so the news really lifted my spirits,” said Dobela. The HSBC Singapore Sevens was last held in 2019, with the Blitzboks overhauling Fiji in a dramatic final. The tournament will be hosted at the Singapore National Stadium on Saturday and Sunday, April 9 and 10, and will be followed by the rescheduled HSBC Canada Sevens, to be played in BC Place, Vancouver, on April 16 and 17.
