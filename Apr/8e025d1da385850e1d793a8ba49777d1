Leaders of Operation Dudula in KZN say there will be no violence from members of the organisation when they protest in the Pietermaritzburg CBD on Thursday. The protest is part of the organisation’s nationwide activities where they have been calling for the eviction of undocumented foreign nationals from the country. Operation Dudula KZN provincial co-ordinator, Mfanafuthi Dumakude, on Wednesday said even though the protesters will visit shops owned by foreign nationals, they will not be violent. He said: Members of the group, who will gather in the CBD this morning, will also deliver a memorandum of grievances at the Jabu Ndlovu Street Police Station. “We will be calling on the SA police to do their job and arrest the foreign nationals who are currently running illegal businesses in Pietermaritzburg. It is unacceptable that South Africans are sitting at home without any economic opportunities while foreign nationals are allowed to operate businesses illegally,” Dumakude said. Operation Dudula members will serve foreign nationals running businesses in the CBD with a notice to cease operations. Dumakude said: Operation Dudula, which was launched in Johannesburg a few months ago, has been criticised for inciting attacks on foreign nationals. The organisation’s leader, Nhlanhla “Lux” Dlamini, is currently facing charges of malicious damage to property, theft and burglary after one of Operation Dudula’s protests in Johannesburg turned violent. While Dumakude said the organisation has informed police about the planned protests, authorities said they were not aware of the march. “We don’t have any such application from Operation Dudula,” Msunduzi traffic department’s senior superintendent, Bheki Xulu, said on Wednesday.
