A 13-year-old girl was killed after being hit by a car while crossing the N2 by the M41 bridge in Umhlanga, Durban. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911’s spokesperson, said the incident happened on Wednesday just after 3pm. He said reports indicate that a group of children, who had been celebrating a friend’s birthday at a nearby shopping centre, were on their way home when a 13-year-old girl was hit by a car while crossing the road. Herbst said when paramedics arrived at the scene, they found that the girl showed no signs of life and was declared dead on the scene. He said the other children were not injured.
