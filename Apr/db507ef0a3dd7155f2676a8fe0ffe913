The family of 33-year-old Phumlile Penelope Mseleje is requesting help in finding her after she was swept away by a river next to their home in Newtown A in Inanda on Monday last week. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, Prem Balram, said Mseleje and her family were forced to flee their home after it collapsed during heavy rainfall and flooding. Balram said her family witnessed her being swept into a river next to their home while they were assessing damages. She has not been found since. “The Rusa helicopter has conducted several flights over the area in the past week in search of survivors and the bodies of those who tragically lost their lives during the floods. Mseleje is one of several people who are still missing and are presumed to have drowned,” said Balram. He said further ground and aerial searches will be conducted during the course of this week.
