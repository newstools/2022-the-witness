The Peter Brown southbound off-ramp has been re-opened following delays due to inclement weather, the South African National Roads SOC Agency Limited (Sanral) has said. Thabiso Dladla, Sanral’s Eastern Region Project Manager, said the Peter Brown southbound off-ramp was finally opened on Wednesday last week. He said the off-ramp is open to traffic with an eight-ton load limit. However, the slow lane will remain closed until construction on the entire slow lane is completed. “The current closure of the southbound slow lane is in place for safety reasons and has reduced the roadway to two lanes approaching the Peter Brown off-ramp. Only the middle and fast lanes are in use,” said Dladla. Dladla said the arrestor bed will remain as the deceleration point to allow heavy vehicles to slow down timeously before moving into the middle lane. Motorists planning to use the Peter Brown off-ramp on the southbound carriageway are advised to use caution and switch to the middle lane early enough and follow the queue of slow-moving vehicles for a safe exit onto the off-ramp. “We appeal to road users to note and comply with the advance warning signs and speed restrictions when travelling past the construction work zones. Motorists are advised to avoid remaining on the fast lane until the last minute before cutting into the middle lane to exit at the off-ramp as this is extremely dangerous,” said Dladla.
