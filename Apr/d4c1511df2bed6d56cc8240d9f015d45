A 45-year-old woman appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrates’ Court today charged with the murder of her child. Madelein Ackerman was charged following the death of her four-year-old daughter in Ballito earlier this week. She was arrested on Tuesday after she allegedly drowned her four-year-old daughter in a bucket of water at their home in Ballito, KwaZulu-Natal. According to Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo, the mother of the child had stated that her child was being difficult and troubling her, and she decided to drown the child in a bucket full of water until she stopped moving. The matter was adjourned to May 5 for a bail application.
