With the KwaZulu-Natal region recovering after heavy rainfall and floods in past days, residents are concerned at reports that more heavy rainfall is expected. The Easter weekend begins on Friday and is traditionally a time when many holidaymakers pack their bags and head off to the coast and remote parts of the country. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) released a statement on Wednesday saying that localised rainfall, heavy at times, could be expected over KwaZulu-Natal. Thursday sees an upper trough starting to develop over the south-western sector of South Africa, expected to bring isolated light showers and thundershowers over the Cape provinces, while the remainder of the country will remain dry. On Friday, the upper air trough is expected to intensify further, resulting in the development of an extensive band of isolated to scattered showers and thundershowers over much of the central interior, like the Northwest, Free State, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal which are likely to experience the return of thunderstorms, along with the risk of localised flooding and/or occurrences of hail and strong, damaging winds. Saturday sees scattered to widespread showers and thundershowers persisting over the central provinces which could spread to the eastern and north-eastern provinces. Sunday and Monday will see rainfall persisting over the central and eastern parts of the country. “The South African Weather Service acknowledges the unconventional naming of the low pressure that has caused devastation over KwaZulu-Natal earlier this week, however this low pressure is not expected to cause any further impacts over the country as it is forecasted to move away from South Africa,” read the statement. SAWS also added that they will continue to monitor any further developments relating to this weather system and will issue subsequent updates as required. Furthermore, the public are urged and encouraged to regularly follow weather forecasts on television and radio.
