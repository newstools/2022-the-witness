Msunduzi administrator Scelo Duma has resigned, city council speaker Eunice Majola announced on Tuesday morning. Duma’s term comes to an end on April 30. He was appointed to the position by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka in February 2020 to turn the fortunes of the ailing municipality. There has been an outcry about the service delivery collapse in the city, with the ratepayers’ umbrella body, Msunduzi Association of Residents Ratepayers and Civics early this month calling for the dissolution of the council as a possible solution to the problem. Earlier this month, chairperson Anthony Waldhausen blamed deep factionalism and differences between camps for the municipal deterioration to an extent that even Cogta has been unable to rescue the situation. Waldhausen said: “We have seen over the years that service delivery has deteriorated to such an extent that the municipality is completely dysfunctional and bankrupt. There is no turnaround and nothing has been achieved during the entire three years under administration from 2019.” Duma’s resignation letter, as read by Speaker Majola during a council meeting on Tuesday, highlighted some reasons for his resignation, which included that the municipality was now ready to stand on its own and take its own decisions. Some opposition parties in council argue that Duma’s views were far from the truth in terms of the facts on the ground. It’s not clear at this stage as to who will take over the reins as no update has been given yet on the appointment of a municipal manager.
