Pietermaritzburg’s most prestigious Art in the Park event has officially begun. This five-day event is back with a bang at the KwaZulu-Natal National Botanical Garden after being locked down for two years. Officials from the Msunduzi Pietermaritzburg Tourism Association, chairperson of the sustainable development committee, CEO of the Creative Arts College and artists from different areas and with different talents attended the opening. Msunduzi’s deputy mayor, Mxolisi Mkhize said: He added that the municipality has big plans for the event in the near future. He said they wanted it to become one of the biggest in the country for artists to showcase their work. “As the municipality we have pledged to restore what used to be great in the city of Pietermaritzburg; we are also working towards ensuring that Alexandra Park regains its original [splendour], so people can take their kids to the parks and rejuvenate among the trees there — so that people reconnect with Pietermaritzburg,” said Mkhize. CEO of the Creative Arts College, Kevin Palium, thanked the artists and small businesses who participated in the event saying their vision for the 60th Arts in the Park event is to go bigger and better than ever. Winners of the “Through the eye of the child” art competition were also announced. This year’s theme is “Covid-19”. Kloof Senior Primary School Grade 4 pupil, Skylar Bonthuys took first prize.
