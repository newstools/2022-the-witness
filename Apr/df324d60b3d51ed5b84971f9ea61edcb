Nando’s will be contacting their former employee in Pietermaritzburg who was dismissed for eating two carrot slices in 2018 to discuss reinstatement. This comes after the court agreed with the CCMA that dismissing Ntokozo Sandile Gwala was not an appropriate sanction in the circumstances of the matter. The court found that it was unfair and that Gwala’s action was not indicative of dishonesty. Gwala admitted to having eaten two slices of carrots without authorisation while on duty on April 8, 2018, but explained he had been tasting them to determine if they were of suitable standards to serve to customers. This month Labour Court acting judge Kelsey Allen-Yaman upheld the ruling by CCMA commissioner, Nicci Whitear-Nel, ordering the reinstatement of the employee. Responding to the court judgement, Nando’s said, “Our code of conduct for employees details our health and safety standards and processes, which does not allow employees on duty to consume any of the products we sell while working.” Nando’s said this is key to ensuring behavioural and commercial integrity for the benefit of all its employees and consumers. Nando’s said it provides restaurant employees with meals for every shift worked. These meals are consumed during allocated breaks included in the scheduling of their work shifts. “When Nando’s dismissed the employee in question, a fair disciplinary process was followed, and the case was presided over by an independent chairperson. “We were under the impression that the employee’s action warranted dismissal in the circumstances. In addition to this, it was believed that this action could potentially affect the health standards policy of the products we produce, therefore putting our consumers at risk.” The restaurant said it respects the Labour Court judgment and will manage further correspondence with Gwala to discuss his reinstatement.
