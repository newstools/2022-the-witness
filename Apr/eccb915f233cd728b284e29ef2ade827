 About 58 healthcare facilities in eThekwini, iLembe, Ugu, Umgungundlovu, and King Cetshwayo districts were severely affected by the floods. The roof, floors and fencing of these buildings have been damaged. The heavy rainfall has left almost 400 people dead and thousands homeless. The department of health said in a statement on Saturday that many hospitals and clinics have been seeing a higher number of trauma and emergency patients than usual – particularly in the densely-populated districts. “Due to the shortage of water and related sanitation challenges, our environmental health practitioners are monitoring clinical statistics for early identification of any water-borne or diarrheal diseases. “This includes the inspection of potable water that is being transported by tankers, and in halls where displaced members of the community are being housed,” said the department. It added that damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, water and power supply systems continues to pose further challenges to the restoration of normal operations at some of these healthcare facilities. “We are also aware that some health workers in areas such as iLembe District have had challenges travelling between work and home, and that some had to sleep in our facilities due to the damage on the roads. “We have made arrangements to accommodate these staffers at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, St Mary’s Marrianhill, and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital”.The department added it is finalising internal administrative processes to source funding so that repair work can start. Most health facilities are fully functional and providing services to patients, with the exception of the following, which are experiencing water supply challenges: Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Wentworth Hospital, Tongaat Community Health Centre, KwaDabeka Community Health Centre, Gamalakhe CHC, Arnold Lushaba CHC, GJ Crookes Hospital, Murchison Hospital, Port Shepstone Hospital, Embo Clinic, Mvutshini Clinic and eNsingweni Clinic
