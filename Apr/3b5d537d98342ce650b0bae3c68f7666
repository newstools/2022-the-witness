A shark scavenged body was found washed up on the shore off Lady Ellen Crescent in La Lucia, Durban, on Friday afternoon. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911’s spokesperson, said reports indicate that while walking on the beach, a man came across the decomposing body of a man lying face down. “A second body was also found on the shore break but had washed back out to sea by the strong surf before lifeguards arrived on the scene.” Herbst said on the scene with Netcare 911 was the Durban Metro Search and Rescue, Ethekwini Lifeguards, Marshall Security, SAPS Search and Rescue Unit, and S.T.A.R.T. He said when medics turned the body over for assessment, it was found that a portion of the right upper arm and right chest area were missing, with multiple shark bite marks clearly visible. Herbst said that although authorities will determine the exact cause of death, it is believed the man had been bitten after drowing. The body was handed over to the Durban North SAPS for further investigation.
