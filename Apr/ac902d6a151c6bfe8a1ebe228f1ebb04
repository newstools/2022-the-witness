Former DA councillor in eThekwini, Marlaine Nair, has joined the party’s KwaZulu-Natal Legislature caucus as its provincial spokesperson on human settlements. The move comes after the departure of former DA MPL, Mbali Ntuli who resigned from the party last month. Nair was sworn in by KZN Legislature speaker, Nontembeko Boyce, on Tuesday morning. Zwakele Mncwango, MPL and chief whip to the DA in the KZN Legislature, said Nair joins the team after having originally served as an eThekwini PR councillor before moving on to represent the DA on the eThekwini ethics portfolio committee, the economic development and planning portfolio committee – where she has served for the past five years. Further positions held within the DA include DA KZN fundraising chairperson, member of the DA federal legal commission, member of the provincial executive committee and member of the DA KZN finance committee. “We have no doubt that with her broad and varied experience she will add great value to our committed team. We look forward to working with our new member as we strive to improve the lives of KZN’s people,” said Mncwango.
