Msunduzi Municipality announced that the repairs have been completed on the bulk water pipeline feeding the Dome Reservoir which burst on Saturday, as a result of the hailstorm. This resulted in residents not having water since Sunday. In a statement on Tuesday the municipality said the system was recharged at 6am and capacity is building at Dome Reservoir and subsequently the reservoirs downstream will start getting water. “We wish to advise the residents that, although water has been restored, it may take some time for all of them to start receiving water due to the demand. However we assure them that by tomorrow the taps will be running. “We would like to apologize once again to the affected community for the inconvenience caused and we thank the residents for their patience,” read the statement.
