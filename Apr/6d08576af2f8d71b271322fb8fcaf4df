Authorities in KwaZulu-Natal have requested that, where possible, all freight movements (trucks) towards the Port of Durban be suspended until the situation at the Port has improved. According to statement released by the Road Freight Association’s chief executive officer, Gavin Kelly, there are already long queues of trucks along the N3. “The Mariannhill plaza has a backlog of 10kms all the way to Hammarsdale and the problem is that (according to the Road Traffic Inspectorate) the local communities are now targeting the trucks for looting. “Access roads around the port have been damaged, container yards, truck depots and trucks themselves have been flooded and damaged and the area is really a disaster at the moment,” said Kelly. He continued to say that logistics operations will be impacted. “There will be delivery disruptions for goods being imported. The association has advised members to delay any departures towards Durban, and to find depots and safe parking areas along the way,” said Kelly. Members have been requested to assist one another to get any vehicles off the road and to secure holding areas until the logistics chain is up and running again. Kelly added that there are no foreseeable shortages in foodstuffs and fuel expected.
