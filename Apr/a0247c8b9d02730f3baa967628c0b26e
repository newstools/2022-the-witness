KwaNyavu residents of Cato Ridge have arrived at the Pietermaritzburg High Court to support their former Chief Sikhosiphi Mdluli. Mdluli was stripped of his chieftaincy in December 2020 by the KwaZulu-Natal premier. The Mdluli family filed a case in court against Premier Sihle Zikalala and Cogta. Residents have since been supporting Mdluli saying that they want him reinstated.  Induna chairperson, Alpheous Mzolo, told The Witness that they will continue supporting Mdluli until a decision has been taken by the court. “If the ruling can come back saying he is no longer our chief, hell will break lose and by that time there is nothing we will be able to do as leaders, apart from protecting ourselves and our families,” he said. This is a developing story.
