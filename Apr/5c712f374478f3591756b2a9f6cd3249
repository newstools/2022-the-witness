Heavy rains have led to flooding in Amanzimtoti, south of Durban. Several images and videos have surfaced of flooded areas in Amanzimtoti central leaving many people stranded. Councillor Andre Beetge of ward 97 in Amanzimtoti has urged residents to stay off the streets. “We have been out since 6 am this morning to try and get people off the roads and emergency services out,” said Beetge. According to Beetge, the Amanzimtoti river mouth is open, however, the volume of water that’s coming down is too great and they are trying to make provisions to help minimize the flow. “We have been in communication with the department of environmental affairs so that we can get authorisation to open the river mouth more so we can get a faster flow seeing that we are expecting more rain,” said Beetge. Meanwhile, most of the schools in the area have reportedly closed due to the deluge and poor weather conditions. Some of the other areas affected by the floods include the N2, with some lanes closed and some congestion on the roads, Warner Beach, San Raphael avenue and San Gabriel avenue.
