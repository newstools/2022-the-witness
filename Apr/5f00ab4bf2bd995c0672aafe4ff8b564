eThekwini Municipality Mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, has asked for patience from protesting communities as the City works to restore services. Following the recent heavy rains which have killed over 300 people in KwaZulu-Natal, critical infrastructure was also damaged leading to many areas being without water and electricity since Sunday. Some communities like Ntuzuma, Reservoir Hills, Mayville, Umlazi and KwaMashu have held service delivery protests in frustration. In a public notice released by the municipality, it said some areas require “extensive upgrades” to their damaged infrastructure which will take months. The municipality said it will be exploring other options in the meantime like water tankers. On Thursday morning, Kaunda held a community town hall meeting in the badly affected area of KwaMamdekazi, Pinetown. Kaunda said the protests were delaying the work of the municipality as workers were being denied access to roads. “We appeal for people to understand that as a municipality we are also facing an unprecedented situation with these floods so protesting, blocking roads and stoning passing municipal cars who are there to fix the electricity problems will not bring about a solution,” he said. Kaunda called on community leaders to bring about calm in their areas. Kaunda also condemned the recent looting that has been happening. Stores in Durban and Umlazi have reportedly been looted, while containers at the old airport were also raided. “Looting is not a culture we should get accustomed to as a city because looting deters investors away,” he said.
