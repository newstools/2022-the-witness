Pietermaritzburg can expect a series of gloomy days this week. Residents will need to get there umbrellas ready and should probably haul out some of their winter woolies. According to the South African weather services, we can expect about a 30% chance of rain and thunderstorms on Monday and again on Wednesday and Thursday. There will be an even larger chance of rain and thunderstorms on Friday going into the weekend. The Witness spoke to weather forecaster Wisani Maluleke, who said there is a cold front approaching, however it could also be impacted by another weather system responsible for inclement weather conditions. “A system called a cut-off low system can also cause this type of weather condition. This system normally brings a combination of rainfall (lot of rain), thunderstorm activities which at times can even get severe and then sometimes we also have colder temperatures meaning that temperatures might drop significantly. “We will monitor the system and we will follow the processes and see if there is a need to issue warnings for the weekend. We do not want to cause panic,” said Maluleke.
