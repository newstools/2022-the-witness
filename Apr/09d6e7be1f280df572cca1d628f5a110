The KwaZulu-Natal government is ready to host about 4000 delegates expected to arrive in Durban for Africa’s Travel Indaba. MEC for Economic Development, Tourism & Environmental Affairs, Ravi Pillay, briefed the KZN executive council this week on the city’s plans on welcoming tourists, saying that KZN will have an opportunity to showcase the myriad of tourism offerings in store for international visitors. Indaba is Africa’s biggest tourism trade show where African countries showcase their destinations to global tourism buyers. According to Pillay, it is estimated that this year’s Indaba will generate R72.5 million. “We will use this year's Africa’s Travel Indaba to showcase some of the new tourism products and attractions that we have and those that are still in the pipeline. Our tourism trade will also get an opportunity to reintroduce their business to international buyers," said Pillay. He added that KZN is fully open for business. “We have been hard at work implementing the tourism recovery plan soon after Covid-19 hit in 2020. While our focus in the past two years have been on domestic visitors, as the world opens, we are ensuring we enhance international destination marketing,” said Pillay. On Tuesday May 3, Tourism KZN and Durban Tourism will host a Business Breakfast where Pillay will highlight key tourism developments that are in the pipeline for KZN. “I am confident that buyers as well as our key tourism stakeholders will be excited to see that KZN is still a must-visit destination that continues to package and sell to their customers back home. The KZN stand will include small tour operators and product owners, and a total of 20 unemployed youth will be employed for the duration of the Indaba to assist delegates at key tourism spots in Durban," said Pillay.
