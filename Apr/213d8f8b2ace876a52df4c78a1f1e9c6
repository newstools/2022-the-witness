The floods experienced in KwaZulu-Natal have been classified
as a provincial disaster. This is in terms of Section 23(1)(b) of the Disaster
Management Act, 2002 (Act No. 57 of 2002). The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional
Affairs (Cogta) said the classification of the floods as a provincial disaster
follows the recommendation and assessments done, by the Provincial Disaster
Management Centre, on the magnitude and severity of the impact of the severe
weather events occurring in KZN that resulted in the loss of life and damage to
property, infrastructure and the environment as a result of heavy rain,
flooding, strong winds and landslides. The Disaster Management Act, Section 40 read with section
23(8), designates the primary responsibility to coordinate and manage this
disaster, in terms of existing legislation and contingency arrangements to the
provincial executive. Accordingly, all state organs are urged to further
strengthen support to existing structures to implement contingency arrangements
and ensure that measures are put in place to enable the KZN Province to
effectively deal with the effects of this disaster.
