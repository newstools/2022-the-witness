Lower parts of the Ladysmith CBD have flooded yet again following weekend rains in the province. Motorists have been asked to avoid the area, including Lyell Street, and all traffic will be diverted through Murchison Street. Officials have warned motorists to expect high traffic volumes in the CBD. More rain is expected to fall, and municipal officials are monitoring the situation. In January this year, 35 people were rescued in the Ladysmith CBD after the Kliprivier Dam burst its banks following heavy rains in the area. Rescue workers had to use boats to get to trapped residents around the town. The town flooded again in March and parts of the CBD area were closed to traffic after more heavy rains. *This is a developing story.
