A number of crocodiles from Crocodile Creek Farm in Tongaat, North of Durban, are on the loose after being washed away by the KZN floods. According to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, they were informed that about 12 crocodiles were washed away during the floods. Ezemvelo spokesperson, Musa Mntambo, said that of the 12 crocodiles, seven have been recaptured. “We are currently looking for the outstanding five,” he said. Mntambo said they also suspect that they might have walked towards the Tongaat River which is less than a kilometer from the farm. A number of videos have been circulating on social media showing a crocodile next to Tongaat River on the M4.
