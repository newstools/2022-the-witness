An Operation Dudula member accused of circulating an inciteful voicenote has been granted bail of R5 000 by the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Dan Radebe, Operation Dudula's deputy chairperson confirmed that their member was arrested on Tuesday by police. Operation Dudula is a movement that started in Johannesburg where a small group of people have been forcibly closing shops belonging to foreign nationals in the townships and city centre. Brigadier Jay Naicker, Kwazulu-Natal police spokesperson said the 36-year-old man was arrested for “incitement to commit public violence”. “They (police) were informed of a voice message that was being circulated provoking the public to mobilise and commit acts of violence against certain people as well as damage their property,” he said. “The suspect was identified after a rigorous investigation and was arrested and detained at the Durban Central Police Station yesterday (Tuesday),” he said. Operation Dudula is set to host a march in Durban this Sunday. Last month, leader of Operation Dudula Nhlanhla 'Lux' Dlamini was arrested on charges of housebreaking, theft and malicious damage to property during one of the organisation's raids in Johannesburg. Dlamini is currently out on bail.
