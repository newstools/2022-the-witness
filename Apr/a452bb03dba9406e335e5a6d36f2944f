South Africans, especially those living in low lying areas
such as KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape are urged to remain vigilant as
persistent showers of rain continue to pour during the Easter
Weekend. The South African Weather Services has warned that rain
accompanied by thunderstorms and strong winds is expected to intensify in some
parts of the country and the risk of flooding remains a
possibility. The government has urged people to monitor rising water
levels, especially in low lying areas, exercise caution when driving through
flooded areas and avoid crossing low lying bridges, water streams and
rivers. The search and rescue efforts including the restoration of
services in the KwaZulu Natal province where floods have caused massive damage
to infrastructure, residential and business properties including loss of lives
are continuing. Concerned citizens are advised to contact their local
municipalities to enquire about available support or call the national
emergency numbers: 112, 10177 and 107. The SA government thanked all non-government organisations,
business owners and individuals involved in assisting the people of KwaZulu
Natal during this time.
