KwaNyavu residents cried tears of joy on Monday on hearing that the Pietermaritzburg high court had reinstated chief Sikhosiphi Mdluli to his position. Hundreds of residents from KwaNyavu chanted outside court on Monday in support of Chief Mdluli. He was stripped of his chieftaincy in December 2020 by the KwaZulu-Natal premier. Mdluli’s family then took premier Sihle Zikalala and Cogta to court. Speaking to his supporters in Market Square after the verdict, Mdluli said the judge ruled that Cogta and Zikalala, did not follow proper procedures to demote him when they were electing regent Thabisile Mdluli. He said: “We will now wait for something in writing from the court detailing the judgement. “We have also met with the lawyers and they have explained everything. What is important is that we succeeded in what we came to court for,” he said. Mdluli said they went to court because they were not satisfied with the demotion, without any valid reason. They were also unhappy that Thabisile Mdluli was made a regent without the Mdluli family and KwaNyavu Tribe being informed. He said that after he receives official papers from the court, his coronation as a chief will take place. KwaNyavu Izinduna chairperson, Induna Alpheous Mzolo, said he is happy with the court’s decision. He said: Mdluli was first given a chieftaincy position in 2000.
