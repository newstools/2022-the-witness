Five more bodies of victims of the recent floods were recovered by the search-and-rescue teams on Tuesday. The various rescue teams from at least three provinces are based at the Viginia Airport, using it as their control centre. The bodies, which increased the death toll to 448, were recovered in Umzinyathi, Mpumalanga in Hammarsdale, Reservoir Hills, Haburg and Henley Dam. The airport was a hive of activity with police divers, paramedics, military personnel and charity groups working together to recover the missing persons. Premier Sihle Zikalala saluted the work done by all involved in the mission for sacrificing their time from their respective provinces and helping bring closure to the families that have been hard hit by the floods. “It is with such pride to see that you have not looked at the situation based on the colour of skin of the affected. You displayed the true sense of patriotic South Africans ... “We want to thank the SAPS, SANDF, the rescue teams gathered here; our hearts, and ourselves as the people of KZN collectively, we salute you for the work you have done,” Zikalala said.
