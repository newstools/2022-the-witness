“She was fearless, brave and dedicated.” These were the words used by an emotional colleague to describe Sergeant Busisiwe Mjwara from the Pietermaritzburg Search and Rescue Police Diving Unit during her memorial service on Thursday in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. Mjwara drowned on Sunday while conducting a search together with other search and rescue members in the Msunduzi River. They were searching for three people who had drowned earlier last week in the Henley Dam area. Mjwara’s close colleague, Sergeant Jesse Mare’ said Mjwara was loved by everyone who knew her. “She began her time in search and rescue in 2016. As a female, she broke all stereotypes and chose to work in an environment that is dominated by men and is not the easiest job to do,” said Mare’. He added she served with all her heart and integrity. “Her memory will live on. Every single call I attend, every single rescue I’ll go out on, she’ll still be with me,” said Mare’ who was in tears. Police officers from different unit, traffic officers, ER24, family and friends were in attendance. *This is a developing story.
