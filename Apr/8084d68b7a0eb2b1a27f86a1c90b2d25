Eskom has announced that it will be implementing stage 2
load shedding from Sunday afternoon. The power utility said it will continue until 5 am on
Wednesday, depending on the level of breakdowns. Eskom said load shedding is implemented only as a last
resort to protect the national grid. It said the loss of four additional generation units at
Matla, Tutuka, Duvha and Arnot power stations over the past 24 hours,
exacerbated by the delay in units returning to service at Camden, Matla,
Grootvlei and Tutuka power stations, has unfortunately necessitated the
implementation of load shedding. The power utility said the power system continues to be
fragile and they are forced to implement load shedding to manage and replenish
emergency generation reserves, on which it has been relying to supply
electricity this week. “Since Friday afternoon, a generation unit each at Camden,
Komati and Arnot power stations returned to service. We currently have 5 474MW
on planned maintenance, while another 17 018MW of capacity is unavailable due
to unplanned breakdowns. “The power system remains unpredictable, and Eskom would
like to inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity
may require higher stages of load shedding. We therefore request the public to
continue using electricity sparingly, as we strive to return units to service,”
said Eskom.
