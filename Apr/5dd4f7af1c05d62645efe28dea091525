The annual Comrades Expo has a new venue. The three day Expo will be hosted at the Durban International Convention Centre (DICC) for the first time in 22 years, from August 25 to August 27. The Comrades Expo, with its forty-year history as South Africa’s largest and longest running expo, was first hosted at Durban’s Royal Hotel in 1983. It was then moved to the Old Pavilion on the Durban Beachfront in 1984 and then to the Durban Exhibition Centre the following year, with a change of venue for only the 2000 race when it was hosted at the Durban International Convention Centre. The iconic expo has a long history with the City of Durban as the main registration point for athletes registering for the Comrades Marathon. Spread over 5,000 square metres, this year’s expo is expected to be another innovative affair. With it being held at Durban’s landmark venue, the expo is expected to bring together runners, supporters, sporting enthusiasts, Comrades Marathon sponsors and partners, as well as local and international visitors. There will be a showcase of sports brands and the latest in running apparel, shoes and accessories, fitness equipment and other products. The Comrades Expo has, over the years, been attracting more than 110 exhibitors and over 50,000 visitors. It is an integral part of Comrades race week and serves as the official registration point for the ultimate human race, where thousands of athletes will collect their race packs, goodie bags, share information and finalise registration ahead of race day. Applications for exhibitors opened from Friday and a booking can be made by contacting Richard Ndhlovu from Synergy Business Events on 011 476 5104 or email: richard@synergybe.co.za or comrades@synergybe.co.za.
