Former president Jacob Zuma has been admitted to hospital after falling ill. According to Zuma’s spokesperson, Mzwanele Manyi, Zuma’s condition was however not critical. “He can talk and walk, but his condition required that he be admitted to hospital,” he said. Zuma was advised by his doctors not to attend Monday’s court proceeding at the Pietermaritzburg High Court where he is facing charges of corruption. The former president is facing criminal charges in connection with his role in the arms deal in the 90s. During Monday’s proceedings, Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge, Piet Koen, granted Zuma’s application for his criminal trial to be postponed. Zuma is seeking the removal of lead prosecutor, Billy Downer from the former president’s criminal case. However, the SCA last month ruled that Zuma’s trial should go ahead, and that Downer should be allowed to continue in his role as the lead prosecutor. Zuma’s legal representative, Advocate Dali Mpofu SC, had argued that the former president’s trial should be postponed to allow SCA President, Mandisa Maya, to rule on Zuma’s application seeking the SCA’s ruling that his trial should go ahead, reviewed. In granting Zuma’s application, Judge Koen postponed the former president’s trial to May 17 – which the judge said was the “holding date”. Should Judge Maya’s ruling be out by May 17, then Zuma’s trial would resume on May 31
