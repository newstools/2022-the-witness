A teenage girl sustained minor injuries after a fire broke out in a house on West Street in the Pietermaritzburg CBD on Friday night. Mi7 Armed Response, Pietermaritzburg Fire Department, SAPS, Strategic Threat and Medical Units were on scene. According to Brandon Drinkwater of the Mi7 National Group the teen was found to have  minor injuries from an assault which took place just before the fire broke out. “While we were on scene, only one injury was reported and the teenage female was transported to hospital for further care,” said Drinkwater. Drinkwater added that Mi7 rescue medics assisted the Pietermaritzburg fire department with battling the blaze. “Once the fire was under control, SAPS and PMB Fire Department started the sweep of the house and the investigation of the scene,” said Drinkwater.
