Following heavy rains and floods in KwaZulu-Natal, two of the province’s dam levels remain on the radar of the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The Ntshingwayo Dam, with the town of Newcastle being the closest, is currently at 82% of capacity. The release from the dam now is at 23.43 cumecs. Cumecs is a cubic metre per second, as a unit of rate of flow of water. The department said this is in line with the 80% operating rule. The downstream communities have been informed of this. The second dam in the DWS radar is the Pongolapoort Dam, known as the Jozini Dam. The dam is currently at 86%. According to the 85% operating rule for the Dam, the DWS should be releasing 38 m?/s but 20 m?/s is being released currently. This lower release is to allow for the security of the infrastructure whilst the communication to communities downstream must still happen. The department’s spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau, said communication to communities downstream is essential as it ensures the protection of lives and livelihoods. He said once that communication is done and people know about it, there is a possibility of the release from Pongolapoort Dam to be raised to the required 38 cumecs. “All sleeve valves are available to release the required amount of water, however it should be noted that the river will overflow when the release of 38m?’/s [happens] and thus the importance of communication to communities downstream who may be flooded if this would happen without notice,” said Ratau.
