The Rossburgh driver license testing centre services is moving to Pinetown after it was damaged in the recent floods. MEC for transport, community safety and liaison, Neliswa Peggy Nkonyeni, visited the centre on Monday to assess the damage at Rossburgh. This is the third time the station has been flooded in recent years. As a long-term solution, the department is also looking at the possibility of relocating the offices because of floods. According to a statement released by the MEC, the centre was completely damaged due to the recent KZN floods. “The information technology equipment with the National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS) is all damaged. Nine patrol vehicles belonging to the department were also damaged,” said Nkonyeni. “The recent floods destroyed many key work areas of the centre, and it will remain closed. We have agreed that Pinetown will be used for issuing licenses. “The bookings that have already been made in Rossburgh will continue in Pinetown during the weekends,” said Nkonyeni. She added that the road traffic management corporation (RTMC) will assist the department in setting up an eNaTIS line in Pinetown while the damage is being assessed. They department is working with the department of public works to obtain temporary office space.
