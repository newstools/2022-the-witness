While no load shedding is currently being implemented, Eskom is urging the public to reduce the consumption of electricity as any further losses of generation capacity would force the implementation of load shedding at very short notice. In a statement, Eskom said the loss of multiple generators over the weekend, as well as delays in returning some generation units to service, has made for a very constrained power system this afternoon. Eskom said it is working on returning a generation unit each at Matimba, Duvha and Arnot power stations to service before the evening peak. “Today a generation unit each at Arnot, Kendal, Matla and Tutuka power stations have been returned to service. “However, we will still be heavily reliant on emergency reserves to meet demand tonight. Emergency reserves are healthy to assist in reducing the supply deficit,” said Eskom. The power utility said it currently has 4 533MW on planned maintenance, while another 13 601MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom would again like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore request the public to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the occurrence of load shedding.”
