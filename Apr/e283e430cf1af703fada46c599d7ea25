The chairperson of the select committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Water and Sanitation, China Dodovu, has called on government to move with speed to declare KwaZulu-Natal a disaster area. This is to ensure that the necessary funds are unlocked to assist flood-ravaged communities in KZN. “We hope the local, provincial and national government will move with speed, in the spirit of cooperative governance as encapsulated in the Constitution, to initiate the process to unlock necessary funding to assist the people of KZN. We are also calling for the speedy repair of critical infrastructure to ensure that the people receive water and sanitation in the affected areas,” Dodovu said. According to the statement, there is a need to urgently put in place mitigation strategies to avert the annual recurrence of such disasters, like improved town planning and building processes to ensure that communities reside in areas that are relatively safe from mudslides. Dodovu also emphasised the need for businesses to contribute to the humanitarian efforts to assist the communities they operate in. “At the centre of these calls is the need to ensure safety to communities and also to ensure that economic recovery which is essential for the sustenance of livelihoods in the affected areas is unlocked,” added Dodovu.
