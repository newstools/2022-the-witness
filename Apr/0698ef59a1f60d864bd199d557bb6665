The KZN Sharks Board, in partnership with various stakeholders, are cleaning up Dakota beach in Isipingo, on Tuesday. The initiative comes after heavy rains and floods engulfed the province, destroying roads, infrastructure and taking the lives of many. As a result, beaches were left in a filthy state. “It is with this reason that the board in partnership with the mentioned stakeholders have decided to assist in cleaning up the beach which plays a major part in beach tourism of the province,” read the statement. It said the board which is mainly responsible for bather protection in the province launched its beach clean-up campaigns in 2014. “The main purpose of these beach clean- up campaigns is to assist and participate in the general upkeep and cleanliness of our beaches. “It is also part of our conservatory efforts to save and preserve the lives of sea creatures, and to encourage the usage of our beaches and thereby grow beach tourism in the province,” read the statement. Other governmental departments, sister entities, businesses and the public have been invited to donate essential goods such as unperishable foods, blankets, sanitary items, baby food and clothing. Meanwhile, the board has been identified as a donation centre where donations can be delivered or dropped off. Their headquarters are in Umhlanga, No. 1 A Herrwood Drive. Donors have been asked to request for acting marketing manager, Nombuso Ngubane.
