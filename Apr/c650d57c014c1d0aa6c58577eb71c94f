Boats have been acquired to rescue workers stuck in shoulder-high water in Isipingo, south west of Durban. The area of Isipingo has been hit hard by the rains, with houses near the Isipingo beach vicinity having been totally flooded. Aidan David, chairperson of the Isipingo Community Police Forum, said they have been fielding calls from people stranded at their workplaces since dawn. “The situation is terrible, it is a state of disaster. I have people from as far as Hibberdene and Warner Beach assisting us with rubber ducks. We are trying to get people out from wherever they are stranded,” he said. David said the area of Crab City is totally underwater with water levels reaching close to 2 metres high. “We need to get people to safety but the challenge we are having is that we have no place of safety. The halls are becoming full and the people have even offered their vacant homes in higher ground which we appreciate but I don’t think it will be enough. We are going to need more supplies and assistance,” he said. David said the situation looks like it is going to get “from bad to worse” as water from the sea continues to push on the river level. This will affect the many houses situated along the river banks in Isipingo, he said.
