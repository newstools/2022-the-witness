Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has raised her concerns about the continued killings of amakhosi and izinduna in KwaZulu-Natal. Mkhwebane said the safety of traditional leaders was in the hands of the provincial government. She said this on the sidelines of a meeting she had with Premier Sihle Zikalala, KZN Legislature speaker Nontembeko Boyce and members of the provincial executive committee in Mayville on Wednesday. Mkhwebane and her deputy, Kholeka Gcaleka, presented their report on the state of governance in KwaZulu-Natal as told through both ongoing and finalised investigations into provincial organs of state. “It is so unfortunate that traditional leaders feel threatened, and they said so themselves. The Municipal Structures Act does specify how amakhosi and izinduna and municipalities should work. This is something that we expect all the relevant departments should work towards finding a resolution,” said Mkhwebane. She said reports would be requested where remedial action remained outstanding in reports they submitted to the KZN provincial government. She said among the reports that her office submitted to the provincial government were investigations on issues of service delivery, maladministration and corruption in the province. *This is a developing story.
