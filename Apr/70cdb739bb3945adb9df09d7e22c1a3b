KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala attended the mass funeral service of six Mdlalose family members who lost their lives during the devastating KZN floods, two weeks ago. Slindile, Uyanda, Lubanzi, Ziyanda, Asanele and Lulama Mdlalose died because of the devastating floods, however, four members of the Mdlalose family are still missing. Zikalala paid his respects to the family at the funeral which was held in Sweetwaters, Okhalweni, near Siyanda High School in Pietermaritzburg. Msunduzi Mayor Mzimkhulu Tebolla also attended the funeral. "A veil of sadness, darkness, and grief has covered the beautiful area of Sweetwaters, an area that is known for its resilience and survival. But still, we know that the rainbow of hope will rise from the clouds to keep our hope burning for a tomorrow that is better than today,” said Zikalala. He said that the torrential rains which battered KwaZulu-Natal for six days left a trail of destruction, devastation, and misery. “More than 400 people lost their lives, and thousands more were left homeless and destitute as their homes and belongings were swept away by the raging floods, described as the worst in recent times to hit South Africa and KwaZulu-Natal."
