A truck driver was left in critical condition after being assaulted by a group of people, then run over by a car, on the M13 east bound in Manors, Durban West. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911’s spokesperson, said reports indicate that a truck driver had pulled off to the side of the road after experiencing mechanical difficulties. “While checking the fault, the [man] was attacked by a number of assailants waiting in the bush. “During the struggle, the man was struck down by a passing car. The attackers continued to beat the man while lying unconscious on the floor. “When other vehicles began to stop, the attackers ran back into the bush.” Herbst said the man had suffered critical injuries and was treated on scene by an emergency care practitioner, who placed the patient on a ventilator. He was then rushed to hospital.
