Standard Bank has closed about 34 branches and support facilities in KwaZulu-Natal until further notice following the recent flash floods. The bank said that they decided to close due to the impact of flooding, and a lack of municipal services like water and electricity as well as communication infrastructure. It said that their branches in the South Coast of KZN, Durban city, and the North Coast have been the hardest hit by the flooding. “We express our deepest and sincerest condolences to those who have been impacted by the devastating floods in the KZN area, and especially those who have lost loved ones. Lives and livelihoods have been disrupted. We will strive to provide banking services where it is possible to do so, and endeavour to open branches that have been closed as soon as humanly possible,” said Jean Hattingh, Standard Bank KZN head for consumer clients. Branches and support facilities will be opened as access to these sites becomes possible and when municipal services have been restored, said Hattingh. “ATMs in these areas will also have been impacted. Customers are urged to use Standard Bank digital channels to transact. Standard Bank is also in the process of assessing the immediate needs of those vulnerable members of our society who have been hardest hit by this catastrophe,” said Hattingh. Hattingh added that announcements will be made in due course regarding Standard Bank’s contribution to providing support relief to these individuals.
