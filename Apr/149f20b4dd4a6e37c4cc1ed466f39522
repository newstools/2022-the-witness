eThekwini Municipality is asking people to stop sharing misinformation that people affected by the recent KZN floods can make insurance claims from the municipality. Chief financial officer, Sandile Mnguni, said the municipality is concerned about the circulation of a public liability insurance claim form for the recent floods. “The municipality would like to clarify that the form is not for KZN disaster relief, and it is a misrepresentation of the City’s relief efforts. “eThekwini does not have cover for the general public against natural disasters. Only assets belonging to eThekwini Municipality are covered in terms of the self insurance policy. We appeal to residents to stop sharing information that is unverified,” he said. Mnguni said those who have been affected by the floods and have insurance cover are encouraged to approach their insurance companies to submit their claims.
