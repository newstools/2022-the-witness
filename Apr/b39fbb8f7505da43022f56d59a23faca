ANC supporters staged a protest outside the Greytown Magistrate's Court on Monday during an appearance of a 20-year-old man charged with the murder of an ANC councillor Thembinkosi Lombo (35). Lombo was gunned down on February 25 in the Greytown CBD. At the time of his death, he was serving as an ANC councillor for ward 13, under the Umvoti Municipality. On Monday, protesters picketed outside court calling for the man charged with his murder not to be granted bail. Journalists and members of the public were denied access to the courtroom. The matter was adjourned in court until April 13 for bail application.
