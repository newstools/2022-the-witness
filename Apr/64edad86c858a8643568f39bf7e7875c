At least 15 schools were damaged in the uMgungundlovu District due to the heavy rains. Seven schools within Msunduzi Municipality that were damaged had either flooded classrooms, leaking roofs, a number of broken windowpanes or leaks in their admin offices. Most of the schools had not reopened as they were still mopping up. Some pupils could not access their schools due to flooded roads and bridges. Apart from the uMgungundlovu district, the MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal, Kwazi Mshengu, said other districts that were badly affected include Ilembe, King Cetshwayo, eThekwini and uThukela. On Wednesday, Mshengu said about 104 schools were damaged in the province on Monday. The last storm that the province experienced was in December where over 186 schools were damaged. Most of these schools have not yet been repaired. Mshengu said: He added that engineers will quantify how much money the department would need to repair the damages, which are expected to cost millions. Secretary for Sadtu in KwaZulu-Natal, Nomarashiya Caluza, said they were concerned about the schools’ infrastructure. “When Covid-19 started and schools were supposed to open, we raised issues of the infrastructure challenges. Unfortunately, all the heavy rains that we are seeing are adding to the pressure of infrastructure challenges. “Unfortunately, these rains are taking us back, because instead of attending to infrastructure challenges that were already there, the department now has to attend to these damaged schools,” Caluza said. “Some schools were not badly affected but teachers and pupils can’t access schools because of damaged roads. Unfortunately, these roads will not be fixed by the department and they rely on another department,” said Caluza.
