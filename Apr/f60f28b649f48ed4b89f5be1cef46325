The department of social development in KwaZulu-Natal is investigating what led to two teenagers drowning at a beach in the South Coast. According to the department, five children absconded from Themba Club and went swimming at Palm Beach in the South Coast on April 14. Two teenagers, Thabo Nondaba (17) and Lungelo Goba (16) allegedly drowned. The department said the other three boys ran back to the centre to report to the senior childcare worker, who went to the scene and immediately reported the matter to the police. The sea search team started looking for boys under water, but they couldn’t be found. Nondaba’s body was swept ashore and was found the next day, while Goba’s body was found on April 16. They were identified by a senior child care worker. Khoza expressed her concern that children were able to abscond from the centre, resulting in the deaths. “We are heartbroken as a result of this incident in which we lost two young lives. As a department, we will do a thorough investigation on what exactly happened and how the children were able to escape without being noticed by their minders. Our understanding is that these children are supposed to leave the centre when going to school. All centres are supposed to be secured all the time as they house children,” said Khoza. She added the department has a service level agreement with the centre and will be coordinating adequate support for the families. She urged child and youth care centres to ensure that they protect children.
