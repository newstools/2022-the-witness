The SA Weather Service (Saws) has issued a warning for disruptive rain for northern KZN on Easter Monday from 10 am to 6 pm. Saws said a surface high pressure system is ridging along
the coast resulting in scattered showers and rain in the north.  They said rainfall has
been observed over these areas since yesterday and it is expected
to persist throughout the day. "Localized minor impacts can be expected
considering that it a busy holiday and there is traffic expected on the roads.Difficult driving conditions can be expected on
dirt roads and minor motor vehicle accidents due to poor visibility and
slippery roads." They also warned of localised damages to mud-based houses and localised mudslides
and soil erosion. The weather office warned that people should avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where
water is above your ankles. "In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above
the expected flood level. In rural areas protect/relocate animals to a safe
place on higher ground. Take caution when traveling on roads as potholes may be
filled with water and there may be sinkholes."
