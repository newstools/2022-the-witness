The iLembe
District Municipality is still experiencing water challenges due to the damaged
infrastructure that was caused by the floods. According to
the district, water provision throughout the district has been compromised. The
municipality said this was because water tankers and bakkies have been damaged.
In some areas the water treatment plants have been flooded. It said
pipes have also been washed away, the existing water tankers cannot access some
areas because the roads have been washed away. “Water is
available in some areas but the quality is poor. This is caused by the high
turbidity levels of raw water. “We are,
however, working very hard to ensure that we provide some level of service under
the circumstances,” said the municipality. The
district urged communities to be patient as they are working around the clock
to deal with the situation.
