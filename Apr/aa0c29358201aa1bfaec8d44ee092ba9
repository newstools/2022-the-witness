The board of the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has suspended the payment of toll fees at the oThongathi and Mvoti toll plazas on the N2 Toll Route in KwaZulu-Natal. Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, said the suspension was to assist communities affected by the closure of alternative roads, which have been damaged by the floods. He said the damage to the roads in KwaZulu-Natal was extensive resulting in the closure of many roads to allow for clearing and rebuilding. “This intervention follows representations from affected communities and a formal request by the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government to ameliorate the plight of road users who were now being forced to use the N2 because of the closure of alternative roads.  This then results in locals and other motorists paying toll fees they would not ordinarily have had to pay were the alternative roads operational,” said Mbalula. The payment of toll fees at the oThongathi and Mvoti toll plazas on the N2 Toll Route was suspended as an interim measure from Friday afternoon. Mbalula said the repair of the alternative roads, while these interim measures are in place, will be prioritized and accelerated so as to make it possible for the affected communities to be able to use them again as soon as possible. He said the cost to Sanral as a result of this decision will constitute an additional contribution by Sanral to the relief of the disaster. “Over the next few months, Sanral will be the lead agency, as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, on the extensive work required to repair roads in the Province. We must work together as government, business and all organs of civil society to respond to the plight of those impacted on by this devastation and do everything in our power to ensure their lives return to normal as speedily as possible,” said Mbalula. A national state of disaster in KwaZulu-Natal was declared by the president following devastating floods.
