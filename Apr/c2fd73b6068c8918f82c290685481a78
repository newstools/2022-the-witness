The ANC eThekwini regional conference is set to start on
Saturday afternoon at Durban's Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Centre
following a three-hour delay. The conference will see the election of new regional
leaders. Former eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede, is set to contest
against the current council speaker, Thabani Nyawose, for the region
chairperson position. According to the ANC KwaZulu-Natal leadership, the delay was
due to the prolonged pre-conference discussions on the delegation list. The results of the regional elective conference were due to
be announced on Sunday. High profile ANC leaders attending the conference include Tourism
Minister Lindiwe Sisulu.
