A 32-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his niece, who was 12 years old at the time. The National Prosecuting Authority said in a statement that the girl was living with her grandmother at the time of the incident in uMzimkhulu, and the uncle lived in Durban. The rape happened one night, when the uncle came to visit them, and the girl told her grandmother, who didn’t believe her. “She ran away from home the following day and was taken in by an elderly woman she did not know. She told the woman what happened, and the matter was reported to the police. The man was subsequently arrested,” read the statement. Meanwhile, in court the man denied the offence and initially even denied being at home that weekend, until he contradicted himself in his evidence. The prosecutor, Mpilonhle Ngobese, handed a victim impact statement compiled by the child to the court. In it she said she felt alone and depressed. She said she had to leave home because nobody believed her when she said her uncle had raped her. She said that even her father abandoned her.
