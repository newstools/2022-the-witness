The speaker of Emadlangeni (Utrecht) Municipality, Mzonjani Mthethwa, has dismissed allegations and reports that the appointment of the acting municipal manager was unlawful. The northern KwaZulu-Natal municipality, run by the IFP, has been accused of allegedly appointing a municipal manager, Grace Mavundla, without following due processes. The municipality issued a statement on Monday. It said Mavundla was appointed on January 6, for three months subject to the finalisation of a pending disciplinary matter involving the suspended municipal manager, Thamsanqa Nkosi. Mavundla was previously a chief director in the KZN Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and also held the position of general manager of corporate services under the Umdoni Municipality.
