President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured the public that government will be assisting families devastated by the recent floods. Ramaphosa arrived in Durban on Wednesday morning where he was briefed by local and provincial disaster management teams. He is expected to make several stops to devastated areas across Durban. His first stop was to the Sokhela family in Clermont where four people died on Monday night due to a structural collapse. Speaking to the Sokhela family, Ramaphosa said he was in Durban to see the damage first hand. “Whatever your problems are, we are with you all the way,” he said. “When we saw the destruction in KwaZulu-Natal we decided to personally come here to see how government can help. I am happy that the Premier (Sihle Zikalala) along with the mayor (eThekwini Municipality Mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda) and their teams have already started helping families.” Over 59 people have been confirmed dead in KZN from the recent heavy rains. The province has since been placed in a state of disaster.
