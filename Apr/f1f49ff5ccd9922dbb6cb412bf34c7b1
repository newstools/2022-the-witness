E-commerce delivery drivers in Durban North have gone on strike over the company’s alleged low commission fees. The drivers who are contracted to e-commerce giant Takealot, which also owns Mr D Food and Superbalist, said they downed tools on Thursday last week. Most of the protesting drivers operate in the ‘Gateway hub’ which services Umhlanga, Phoenix and other Durban North areas. They do deliveries for Superbalist and Takealot, as well as food deliveries for Mr D Food. The striking drivers told The Witness they want to be paid a standard delivery fee of R35 per trip. The current rate stands at R26,40 per trip, but they said the 40cents was recently added on an interim basis. Zwelakhe Mcineka, one of the striking workers, said the rising fuel costs were making it hard for drivers to earn a profit. “The distances that we cover are too long for the money that we are getting,” he said on Tuesady. The drivers said they were not going back to work until their demands were met. At the time of publication the Mr D Food App did not have a delivery option for all restaurants based in the Gateway Theatre of Shopping Centre. The Witness has reached out to Takealot Group for a comment but none has been received.
