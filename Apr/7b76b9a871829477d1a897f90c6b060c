The N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) has warned motorists of busy
traffic conditions expected on the N3 Toll Route this weekend. N3TC said peak traffic places additional pressure on
drivers. Motorists have been urged to plan ahead and to stay informed
to avoid high-risk situations such as emergency incidents, poor weather
conditions, road closures or traffic congestion which may lead to delays,
fatigue, a loss of concentration and even driver negligence.
