The crucial ANC eThekwini regional conference was on Sunday afternoon at risk of collapsing following a stand-off over credentials. The conference, which officially kicked off in Durban on Saturday, was on Sunday in limbo after delegates could not agree on whether the ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) and the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) should have voting rights at the gathering. Both the ANCWL and the ANCYL were led by regional task teams (RTTs) after the terms of office of the their regional leadership structures had expired. Former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, was set to contest against the current council speaker, Thabani Nyawose, for the eThekwini regional chairperson position. By late Sunday afternoon, the supporters of both Nyawose and Gumede had gathered outside the Durban ICC to support their respective candidates. The convener of the ANC eThekwini regional task team (RTT), Kwazi Mshengu, confirmed that the ANC provincial executive committee (PEC) had resolved that the leagues should not have any voting rights at the conference. “The conference has no powers to change the decision of the PEC,” he said. According to the agreement between the ANC and the owners of the conference venue, the gathering should end at 7pm on Sunday. However, given the delays caused by the stand-off over the credentials, it was unlikely that the conference would have concluded its business by 7pm. Mshengu said the ANC was negotiating with the owners of the venue to have the booking duration of the event extended.
