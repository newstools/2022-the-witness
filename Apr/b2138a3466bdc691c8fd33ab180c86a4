Nine people have been injured following an accident involving two trucks and a taxi on the N3 between Camperdown and Cato Ridge on Saturday morning. Mi7 emergency services, ER24, Netcare 911, Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI), SAPS and the fire department were all on scene. According to Brandon Drinkwater of Mi7 emergency services, there were two trucks involved and one taxi. “Investigations are still being conducted but it looks like a truck caused the taxi to drive into another truck,” said Drinkwater. He also added that the people suffered minor to moderate injuries and that there were no deaths. “The patients were transported to various hospitals,” said Drinkwater.
