A taxi owner from Oakford in Durban was gunned down, assassination-style, on Wick Street in the Verulam CBD on Sunday afternoon. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram, said reaction officers responded to the Verulam CBD just before 4 pm after hearing rapid gunfire in the vicinity of the bus rank. “While officers were attempting to locate the scene of the shooting, they were routed back to Rusa headquarters after the controller on duty reported that a Foton minibus taxi drove onto the premises at a high rate of speed with a man screaming for assistance. “On arrival, Rusa medics discovered a body in the passenger seat. He was shot multiple times and was declared dead.” Balram said the man who was driving the bullet-riddled taxi told them that the taxi boss was sitting alone in his vehicle at the bus rank when three men with high calibre rifles walked up to him and opened fire. The man told Rusa that when he ran to the taxi owner’s aid, the gunmen opened fire in his direction before fleeing in a silver VW Polo that was parked on the R102 behind the bus rank. “The man proceeded to the vehicle and noticed the owner slumped in the driver's seat. He moved him over to the passenger side and drove him to the Rusa offices with the hope that he was still alive. Several high calibres spent cartridges were recovered in the taxi.” The motive for the shooting is believed to be related to ongoing taxi violence. On February 14, a taxi boss (39) died after he was shot multiple times in the head and back at his home on Old Inanda Road in Verulam. In another incident also in February, a 40-year-old taxi boss from Parkgate in Verulam was gunned down in Verulam on Wick Street. According to police, the man was shot dead by unknown gunmen while in his vehicle.
