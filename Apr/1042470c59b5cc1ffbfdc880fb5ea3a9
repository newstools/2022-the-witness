Stage 4 load shedding will continue until 5 am on Friday as Eskom works on returning units to service. Load shedding was increased from Stage 2 to Stage 4 on Tuesday morning as a result of the failure of two additional generation units. The power utility said it will continue to adjust the stage of load shedding depending on the level of breakdowns. “Load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore request the public to continue using electricity sparingly, as we strive to return units to service,” said Eskom. Eskom said a generation unit each at the Tutuka and Majuba power stations tripped on Tuesday morning, adding to the failures of a unit each that had tripped at Tutuka, Camden, Matla and two units at Majuba on Monday. Since Monday a unit each at Hendrina, Medupi, Tutuka, Arnot and two at Camden power stations have been returned to service. “We currently have 5 124MW on planned maintenance, while another 16 519MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns. “Eskom would like to apologise for the implementation of load shedding. The power system remains unpredictable, and Eskom will continue to closely monitor the power system and promptly inform the public should there be any significant developments.”
