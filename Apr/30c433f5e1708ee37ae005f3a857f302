Avbob mutual assurance society has set aside R7 million for immediate assistance to communities of KwaZulu-Natal which have been severely affected by the floods in the province. According to a statement released by the organisation, they are doing this in the spirit of Ubuntu as they believe that Ubuntu remains the cornerstone that ties together South Africans. “The AVBOB donation is aimed at assisting individuals and organisations in the region, and it will be distributed in partnership with Gift of the Givers, Rise Against Hunger and the SPCA. The collective support will amongst others entail blankets, clothes, and food,” read the statement. In addition, Avbob has added that they will provide free funerals to a maximum of R20 000 per deceased, to assist families to bury their loves ones lost through the devastation. “For assistance with a free funeral, affected residents in KwaZulu-Natal should contact their nearest Avbob funeral branch in the province,” read the statement. Avbob also added that they will also support their staff members in the province who are directly impacted by the disaster.
