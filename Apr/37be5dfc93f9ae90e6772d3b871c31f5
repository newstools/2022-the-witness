This Freedom Day, April 27, Netflix is bringing action thriller Silverton Siege, a film directed and created by renowned South African filmmaker, Mandla Dube to its platform. Set in 1980, the film is inspired by the real-life incident that sparked the global ‘Free Mandela’ movement and features South African stars Thabo Rametsi, Noxolo Dlamini, and Stefan Erasmus. Rametsi, Dlamini, and Erasmus portray the Silverton Siege trio - three young freedom fighters with nothing left to lose. Following a high-speed car chase with the police after a thwarted sabotage mission, the trio ends up seeking refuge in a South African bank in Silverton, Pretoria. Taking the bank and its customers hostage, and demanding the release of Nelson Mandela in exchange for the release of the prisoners, the stakes and tensions run high. Dube, says: “Silverton Siege is my strongest work thus far, the hope is that filmmakers from Africa are given more opportunities at decolonizing the narrative of who we are. I also hope that the youth of today can draw inspiration from the Silverton Siege trio, and know that they have the power to change the status quo, and most importantly that their stories matter.” The film also stars South African heavyweight Arnold Vosloo alongside a number of well-known South African talents, including Tumisho Masha, Michelle Mosalakae, and Elani Dekker. Silverton Siege will be available to all 222 million subscribers in 190 countries.
