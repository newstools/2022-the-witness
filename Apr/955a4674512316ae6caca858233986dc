Khoza urged the police to ensure that perpetrators should be found and face the full might of the law. “It is very hard to comprehend that innocent and defenceless women can be brutally killed like this. Such barbaric acts should be condemned by all peace-loving people in our society. The killing of women sets us backward as a nation,” said Khoza.
