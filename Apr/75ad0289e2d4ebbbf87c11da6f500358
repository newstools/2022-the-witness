A large number of tourists are expected to visit KwaZulu-Natal for the Easter long weekend despite the recent floods. The KZN government said tourists were welcome in the province. “Tourists can still enjoy themselves while also keeping safe,” said Sihle Zikalala, KZN Premier, during a media conference on Thursday. Over 340 people have died from the recent floods in KZN, with a large majority (301) being from eThekwini. The eThekwini Municipality has estimated the damage to infrastructure to be over R757 million. All beaches in Durban have also been closed for any recreational activities "due to hazardous conditions." Zikalala said KZN was expecting 366 503  people with hotel occupancy rates standing 47%. “We can report that the number of vehicles going through the toll gates suggests to us that there were quite large volumes of potential tourists coming to KZN from the two source markets which are Gauteng and intra- KZN,” he said. Zikalala said tourism contributes 10% to the provincial government’s economy and it was important to keep this sector running as it was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2021 July civil unrest. Zikalala said tourists should expect delays as major roads and freeways in the province are still being repaired following rain damage. Two lanes from the N3 to Durban are closed while there are also delays at the Mariannhill toll plaza. On Friday, Zikalala will accompany Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula and Minister of Water and Sanitation Senzo Mchunu to assess damages to critical infrastructure.
