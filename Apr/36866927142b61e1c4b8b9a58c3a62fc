The eThekwini Municipality, in partnership with the department of agriculture and rural development, has embarked on a vaccination campaign against rabies. The campaign is set to run from April 5 to 11 in Merebank, Austerville, Clairwood and the Bluff. According to a statement released by the municipality’s spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, the vaccination is free and aims to curb the spread of rabies and to improve rabies knowledge among communities. “Pet owners must bring their animal’s certificate from the previous vaccinations. If they do not have one, a certificate will be issued on the day,” said Mayisela. Meanwhile, rabies has been dubbed as prevalent in Durban, with the south sub-district being mostly affected, followed by the west and north sub-districts. “Domestic dogs are the most common reservoir of the virus, with more than 99 percent of human deaths related to rabies being caused by dog-mediated rabies,” said Mayisela. The statement also highlighted the challenge of people who have been bitten by a rabid animal delaying seeking medical treatment. The municipality has urged the public to call 031-3115150, 031-3115153 or 031-3115162 for more information on the vaccination schedule.
