The search continues for the two KwaZulu-Natal children who were swept away while trying to cross a river in Bulwer, outside Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday. Nqobisani Sthole (10) and Mbali Mthembu (15) tried to cross Indluzena river shortly after a storm started on Saturday afternoon and were swept away. Ward councillor, Vusi Mthembu, said the search and rescue team started the search at the Indluzena river on Sunday but could not find the children. “They are continuing with the search today at a bigger river connecting rivers in the area called the Uhhana river,” said Mthembu. He said both Nqobisani and Mbali’s fathers were part of the search. “The families are very worried, it’s painful and we are all hoping to find them. Members of the community are also helping search for the children,” Mthembu said. He added more than 500 households were damaged due to the heavy rains and strong winds. “One of the houses collapsed and killed a child,” said Mthembu.
