The Provincial House of Traditional Leaders (PHTL) in
KwaZulu-Natal has called on all traditional leaders to provide their support in
mop-up operations and relief efforts. This follows the natural disaster which occurred recently in
many parts of the province. The house said areas under the authority of traditional
leaders were negatively affected by the marauding floods which damaged
infrastructure, public facilities and business and residential properties. It said in areas under traditional leaders, infrastructure
such as low-lying bridges and access roads, public facilities such as schools
and service centres and residential properties were damaged by floods which
were caused by torrential rains. “We’re calling on all traditional leaders in the province to
provide the necessary support to government, Non-Profit Organizations (NPO's)
and Non-Government Organizations in mop-up operations and relief efforts,” said
the PHTL, under the leadership of Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza. Chiliza said they are also calling on the government and
relevant stakeholders to ensure that they involve traditional leaders in all
activities pertaining to mop-up operations, relief efforts and rebuilding plans
for areas under their authority. He said the recent floods not only caused damage to
infrastructure, public facilities and business and residential properties but
also the loss of lives. The PHTL conveyed condolences to all the families who have
lost their loved ones as a result of the recent floods.
