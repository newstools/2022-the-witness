Five more bodies of the recent floods victims were recovered by the search and rescue teams on Tuesday. Various rescue units from at least four provinces of the country based at the Viginia Airport using it as their base centre made the recoveries. Premier Sihle Zikalala saluted the work done by the SAPS and the SANDF for sacrificing their time from their respective provinces to bring closure to the families who have been hard hit by the floods. "It is with such pride to see that you have not looked at the situation based on the colour of skin of the affected. You displayed the true sense of patrioric South Africans. Continue bringing closure to those families who have lost their loved ones, and those who are still confused by the impact of this disaster," said Zikalala.
