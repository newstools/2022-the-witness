Several roads in KwaZulu-Natal were closed on Tuesday morning due to flooding caused by the heavy rains that caused havoc in different parts of the province. In Durban, on the N2, both carriageways near the old airport were water logged and closed. The roads near Umhlali were also closed due to the Umhlali River bursting its banks on Monday. Lanes on the M4 southern freeway were waterlogged. The N3 southbound just past the Mariannhill Toll, was also closed in the morning due to heavy waste that flowed onto the road. Zinhle Mali of the Road Traffic Inspectorate said a number of roads were water logged while others were closed off due to flooding. “Several roads at Amanzimtoti in the CBD are water logged and Umlazi is a no go area,” said Mali. The department of transport has also warned drivers travelling between Gingindlovu and Mtunzini in the vicinity of the Emoyeni river bridge to be cautious due to flooding over the actual bridge where a car has been washed off. There were also pools of water in various places on that route.
