Minister of Higher Education, Dr Blade Nzimande wants to turn the Imbali Education and Innovation Precinct into another economic hub in Pietermaritzburg. He said having new industries, technology and innovations at the precinct will help boost the economy of Pietermaritzburg and tackle the unemployment problem. He was speaking on Thursday during his visit to the Imbali Education and Innovation Precinct to monitor the progress in the implementation of this project. The initiative was established in 2014 as a ministerial project. It explores an alternative modality of education delivery. It comprises education institutions in the area, which are able to collaborate with each other, as well as industry and civil society organisations. Among the seven educational institutions in the area is the Durban University of Technology Indumiso Campus. “My own dream in 10 years’ time about this precinct is that there should be new industries emerging out of the innovations that will come from a place like this. Nzimande said: He said this project will have huge benefits, not just for the Imbali youth, but for the entire city. “The youth will be able to acquire important skills, not only for the purpose of getting a job, but also to start their own enterprise from what they can learn. That is very important in addressing the issue of youth unemployment,” he said. He said last week they established a steering committee which will guide the project and invited business people from Pietermaritzburg who are potential investors to get involved. He said the precinct requires partnerships with industry. Nzimande also took a tour of the facility, which includes the uMgungundlovu TVET College, Zubukezulu Secondary and Sukuma High School.
