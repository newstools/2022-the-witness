The Willowton Group says that it has been clearing a section of the Baynespruit River over the past four months. It said the recent flooding revealed that this section of the river was not as severely impacted because of the work done. According to the group quality and food safety manager, Dr Abie Khan, the riverbank was still clear after the recent flooding as there was very little debris. “The clean-up is ongoing and, as has been said before, will only have a significant impact if other players join the cause. Cleaning a 1km stretch of the river is only going to have an aesthetic impact in the vicinity of the clean-up,” said Khan. He also added that the group has been working tirelessly with DUCT (Dusi Umgeni Conservation Trust) as a fellow founder of the Baynespruit Conservancy in 2020, to rally neighbouring industries and local government in Pietermaritzburg to clean up the provincial capital’s rivers. According to the statement released by the group, high levels of E.coli have been recorded in the past couple of months, posing a serious threat to residents living along the banks as it has been linked to liver and kidney damage, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting, fever, muscle and joint pains and skin irritations. “Those attempting to irrigate crops in the Sobantu community have been unable to use this river water as it is too toxic,” read the statement. He added that the sewage in the Baynespruit, which makes its way into the Msunduzi and Umgeni Rivers and ultimately into the Inanda Dam is also feeding concentrations of harmful blue-green algae and a water hyacinth infestation which is severely compromising water quality.
