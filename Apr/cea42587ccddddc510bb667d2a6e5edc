The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of more disruptive rains expected in KZN on Friday and Saturday and urged those in the affected areas, which include Durban, to stay at home. The weather office said a cold front is expected to approach from the west on Friday afternoon accompanied by strong southwesterly winds and scattered showers and thundershowers becoming widespread on Saturday. “The persistent rainfall from Friday afternoon to Saturday might result in localised flooding and more landslides considering that the soil is still saturated, drainage systems blocked and riverbanks have burst. Generally, the situation is still very volatile and more rainfall might result in further destruction in areas along the south coast and adjacent interior,” said Saws. Areas expected to be affected include eThekwini, KwaDukuza, Mkhambathini, Ndwedwe, Ray Nkonyeni, Umdoni and Umzumbe. Those living in these areas can expect flooding of roads and settlements, displacement of affected communities, possible damage to roads and bridges and poor driving conditions. Sinkholes, mudslides, rockfalls and soil erosion are also possible. Damage to settlements and major disruption of traffic is possible. If possible, people are encouraged to stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level. In rural areas move livestock to higher grounds.
