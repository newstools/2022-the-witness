The infrastructure of a property in Aurora Place at Bombay Heights in Northdale is being undermined by water overflowing from damaged water pipes. Kailaspathee Devpersad said they started having problems in December during the heavy rains. She said there is a leaking pipe behind their house. “The municipality used to dig a trench there to stop water from running down to our houses but they stopped doing this. When it rains now the water runs right into my yard. It has damaged furniture inside and the tar in the yard,” said Devpersad. She added she has tried to get help from the municipality but had not received any assistance. “I’ve spoken to at least three people and was recently told to ask my neighbours to help me dig the trench,” she said. Msunduzi Municipality was unable to comment by the time of going to print.
