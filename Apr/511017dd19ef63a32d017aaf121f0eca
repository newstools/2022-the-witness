A woman was killed in a landslide after her house collapsed on her in Westville, KwaZulu-Natal. Medi response search and rescue division, ER24 and police rescue personnel were on scene. According to Paul Herbst of Medi Response, a single residential dwelling had been engulfed by displaced soil, following a landslide. “Crews worked frantically, searching the scene. Following three hours of forcing access using various rescue tools, crews were successful in locating and extracting family members from the house,” said Herbst. He also added that a woman was unable to evade the landslide and was killed. Teams continue to respond to emergencies throughout the province and residents have been urged to remain home, if possible, until such time flood waters have dispersed.
