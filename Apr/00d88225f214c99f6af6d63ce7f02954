KwaZulu-Natal residents have been left frigid following the deluge weather conditions, floods and now load shedding. Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 5pm this afternoon until 5am on Wednesday. This is due to the continued shortage of generation capacity. According to a statement released by Eskom, the constraint supply situation will persist throughout the week, meaning that there are more possibilities of load shedding being implemented, should the generation capacity deteriorate further. “Unit 5 of Medupi power station returned to service during the night. Three generating units at the Camden power station ripped during the night, contributing to the current shortage of capacity,” read the statement. Eskom teams are working hard to return as many of these units to service as possible. “We are managing the emergency generation reserves to limit the stage of load shedding. The overnight load shedding will be used to replenish the dam levels at the pump storage power stations in preparation for the remainder of the week. “We will communicate should there be any significant changes to the supply situation,” read the statement.
