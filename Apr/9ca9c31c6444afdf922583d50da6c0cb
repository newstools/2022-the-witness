Most dam levels in KwaZulu-Natal remain above average as the winter season creeps in. This is according to the Department of Water and Sanitation weekly report on the status of reservoirs, which showed a marginal increase from last week’s 89.3% to 89.6%. Department’s spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau, said KZN’s main water supply system, Umgeni, currently stands at 101.5% from last week’s 101.8%. During a same period last year the system stood at 84.9%. Ratau said Ntshingwayo Dam on the Ngagane River is up from 77.9% to 78.3% while the Hazelmere Dam supplying the province’s North Coast stands at 60.8% from 58.9% and Driel Barrage Dam on the Tugela River remains steady at last week’s 96.7%. Meanwhile, Ratau said on the Umgeni Water supply system, the Midmar Dam is at 100.5% this week from 100.8% last week and Nagle Dam records 101.1% from last week’s 101.9%. The Albert Falls Dam, which is one of the province’s largest dams, is slightly down from last 101.9% recorded in the previous week to 100.8%. This time last year it stood at 54.2%. The Woodstock Dam has seen a marginal increase from 91.1% to 93.6%, Craigie Burn, Mearns and Spring Grove dams have recorded 100.5%, 105.7% and 100.9% respectively. The dams stood at 100.6%, 110.3% and 101.4% last week. Ratau said the department is calling on residents to continue using water sparingly even as dam levels remain steady. “Data received from hydrologists in the department shows us that the effects of climate change have really heightened the unpredictability of our weather patterns, especially rainfall. “In simple terms, dams can be full to capacity today, and almost empty in a few months. It is for this reason that we call on everyone to be very prudent with water use in their homes,” said Ratau. He added that poor domestic water usage is a persistent challenge while also admitting that municipalities also have a critical role to play to ensure water leaks and malfunctioning infrastructure are attended to with the urgency required. “While we urge residents to use with care, we call on municipalities to up their socks and attend to matters relating to water leaks, the refurbishment of water infrastructure as well as water reticulation. South Africa is a water scarce country and if we do not all do what we are meant to do, we will be in serious trouble in the future,” he said.
