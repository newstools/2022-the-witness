The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said it has been actively monitoring areas most impacted by the floods, which ravaged KwaZulu-Natal last week. Commissioners visited families and shelters housing hundreds of displaced children. In a statement, the commission said, “The SAHRC celebrates the civil society, faith-based organisations, civic structures, and groupings of people who have come together to respond to this human crisis”. According to the statement, the commissioners have also engaged with the Office of the Premier for a human rights-based approach in the development and implementation of responses by government, saying that they also shared matters that the commission will take forward relating to infrastructure, access to water and climate justice. “On Wednesday afternoon, the commission rallied civil society organisations, networks, and non-governmental organisations to a consultative session. “Participants shared their experiences and observations with the commission, thereafter, agreeing on a way forward to advance collective human rights responses on the ground,” said the statement.
