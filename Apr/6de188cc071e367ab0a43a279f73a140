Rescue teams are currently searching for fourteen people
from two families who were swept away during the floods in Inanda this week. Reaction Unit South Africa’s (Rusa) spokesperson, Prem
Balram, said they received a call from some rescue workers requesting
helicopter support in locating the people who were swept away. “Fourteen people including women and children were swept
into the Mzinyathi River in Inanda after their homes collapsed during heavy
rainfall. The 14 dead are from two families, Mjeje and Mdlalose,” said Balram. He said two bodies were recovered under a tree trunk, and
they’re now searching for the 10 other bodies. Balram said the pilot and crew will be lifting off shortly
heading to the river in the vicinity of the Seme Store in Mzinyathi.
