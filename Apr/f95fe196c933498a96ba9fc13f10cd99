The family of a Durban newsreader, who died after she was allegedly assaulted by a man she was in a relationship with, said they never saw the signs of abuse. Thandazile Mthethwa (24) worked at commercial radio station, Vuma FM. Mthethwa’s father, Siyabonga Mthethwa, said he was shocked to hear of what his daughter had been going through. Mthethwa said even people close to his daughter said they did not know she was going through a difficult time. Thandazile was allegedly assaulted by her boyfriend a week ago, before he locked her inside her house. She managed to escape through a window. Her father said he took her to the clinic later that day and she was transferred to the hospital where she died on Wednesday. Siyabonga said: “In February, when she came home I noticed she had lost weight, but she said she was fine. She again came back home with a swollen face, but said it was nothing,” he said. He said last week she had lost more weight and her face was badly swollen. “That’s when I took her to the hospital and learnt that she was being abused. We did open a case of intimidation,” he said. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development, Nonhlanhla Khoza, called for justice in the matter. “It is truly unfortunate and disturbing to us as a province to learn that Thandazile died as a result of abuse that she had allegedly suffered for a long time at the hands of her boyfriend. Gender-based violence has robbed us of many young and bright women in this province,” said Khoza. She called on the police to arrest the alleged perpetrator and for friends and colleagues of gender-based violence victims to come forward.
